<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 19, <a href="#footnote_31">note 3</a>. This picture of the two natives, most likely churls, carrying
the King’s body on the cart, is singularly like the story of Rufus’ own end to
which we shall come presently.</p>

<p><a href="#cross"><abbr title="page 27, line">p. 27, l.</abbr> 5</a>. I should not have said “<em>a</em> relic,” as I find that the black cross
of Scotland is a relic of great fame, as indeed is almost implied in the story.</p>

<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27, <a href="#footnote_48">note 5</a>. See <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 167.</p>

<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 28, <a href="#footnote_54">note 5</a>. Munch (<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Det Norske Folks Historie</span>, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 471&ndash;475, for an
introduction to which I have to thank Professor Fiske of Cornell University)
connects this entry with the account of Magnus’ dealings with Man, spoken of
in <a href="#Page_138"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 138</a>, and with every likelihood supposes an earlier expedition of Magnus
in 1093, in which he appeared in both Scotland and Man, and which the
writers of the Sagas have confounded with his expedition in 1098. We can
thus understand the mention of Godred, who was certainly alive in 1093, and
certainly dead in 1098. See also Anderson, Preface to Orkneyinga Saga, <abbr title="pages 33&ndash;34">pp.
xxxiii-xxxiv</abbr>.</p>

<p><a href="#Breton"><abbr title="page 31, line">p. 31, l.</abbr> 14.</a> Not “the Breton Count Alan,” at least not the Count of the

<p><a href="#southwest"><abbr title="page 49, line">p. 49, l.</abbr> 22</a>, for “south-western” read “north-western.”</p>

<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 62, <a href="#footnote_150">note 5</a>. Mr. Fowler writes to me that “what is left of William of
Saint-Calais is under the floor in the part of the chapter-house still used.
W. G. has one of his shoes. They began at the west end in burying the
bishops in the chapter-house, and gradually worked eastward, ending with
Kellow before the bishop’s seat at the east end. Rites of Durham (Surtees
Society ed. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 47) gives the names as they were ‘ingraven upon stone with
the figure of the crosse + annexed to every of their said names,’ i.e. on the
chapter-house floor, and between ‘Walcherus’ and ‘Ranulphus comes’.</p>

<p class="center pneg">‘Willielmus Episcopus.’</p>

<p class="unindent pneg">We found further east ‘Will. Secundus Episcopus’ [that is William of Saint

<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 93, <a href="#footnote_224">note 2</a>. I presume this is the same king of whom we shall hear a

<p><a href="#Rhydygors"><abbr title="page 97, line">p. 97, l.</abbr> 2 from bottom</a>. I have been unable to fix the exact site of Rhyd-y-gors;
but I believe it is to be looked for in Caermarthenshire.</p>

<p><a href="#Yspwys"><abbr title="page 101, line">p. 101, l.</abbr> 13</a>. I am also unable to fix the exact site of Yspwys.</p>

<p><a href="#line134_7"><abbr title="page 134, line">p. 134, l.</abbr> 7 from bottom</a>, for “Ulf” read “Wulf,” as in <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 14. The
<span class="pageno">xxiv</span>
English spelling is the better, but I suppose I was carried away by Scandinavian
associations.</p>

<p><a href="#line134_11"><abbr title="page 134, line">p. 134, l.</abbr> 11</a>. <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Munch (Det Norske Folks Historie</span>, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 511) oddly refers
to William of Malmesbury as making the companion of Magnus Barefoot,
not a younger Harold, but the Magnus whom we have already heard
of as our Harold’s son, as I suppose, by Eadgyth Swanneshals. But William
of Malmesbury distinctly says Harold, and I can see nothing about it in the
places in the Saga of Magnus and the Orkneyinga Saga to which he refers.</p>

<p><abbr title="page 136, line">p. 136, l.</abbr> 4 from bottom, for “Cronan” read <a href="#Crouan">“Crouan.”</a></p>

<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 138, <a href="#footnote_364">note 1</a>. This is placed in the year 1098.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_144"><abbr title="page 144, line">p. 144, l.</abbr> 1</a>. I know not by what carelessness I contrived, after referring
(see <a href="#Page_131"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 131</a>) to Giraldus’ account of the earlier doings of the two Earls in
Anglesey, to leave out all mention of his account of Hugh of Shrewsbury’s
death, which follows immediately (<abbr title="Itinerarium Cambriae">It. Kamb.</abbr> <abbr title="two 7, volume six page">ii. 7, vol. vi. p.</abbr> 129) on the
story of the desecration of the church of Llantryfrydog. It agrees on most
points very minutely with the narrative of Orderic; but it does not seem to be
borrowed from it;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Accesserant ad insulæ portum ab Orchadum insulis piratæ in navibus
longis; quorum adventum ubi comes audivit, statim eis usque in ipsum mare,
forti residens equo, animose nimis occurrit. Et ecce navium princeps, cui
nomen Magnus, primæ navis in prora cum arcu prostans sagittam direxit. Et
quanquam comes a vertice capitis usque ad talum pedis, præter oculos solum,
ferro fideliter esset indutus, tamen dextro percussus in lumine, perforato
cerebro, in mare corruit moribundus. Quem cum sic corruentem victor ab
alto despiceret, superbe in victum et insolenter invectus, dixisse memoratur
lingua Danica, ‘Leit loupe,’ quod Latine sonat Sine salire. Et ab hac in
posterum hora potestas Anglorum in Monia cessavit.”</p>

<p>The only difference between this story and Orderic’s is that, while Orderic
makes Magnus mourn when he learns whom he has slain, Giraldus puts into
his mouth two good Teutonic words of triumph, which sound a great deal more
natural. On the other hand we cannot accept Giraldus’ account of the immediate
result of the encounter as regards Anglesey, which quite contradicts
the witness of the Welsh writers. His statement however is true in the long
run, as Anglesey was delivered again the next year. See <a href="#Page_146"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 146</a>.</p>

<p>In the Orkneyinga Saga, <abbr title="100 29">c. xxix.</abbr> (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 55, Anderson), Magnus “takes a psalter

Hálogoland shoot at the same time, and hit “Hugh the Proud,” much as in
the other versions. He and “Hugh the Proud” are oddly spoken of as
“British chiefs.”</p>

1093&ndash;1098.</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap negindent">THE year of Anselm’s appointment to the archbishopric, <span class="sni">Events of the year 1093.</span>
that part of the year which passed
between the day when the bishop’s staff was forced into
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
his hand and the day when he received consecration
from Thomas of Bayeux, was a time full of stirring
and memorable events of quite another kind. <span class="sni">Relations between England and Scotland. War of 1093.</span> It was
now that some of the events of former years were to
bring forth fruit. The relations between England and
Scotland were of a kind which might lead to open warfare
at any moment.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
This year the open warfare came.
And it was a warfare which was far more important in
its direct results than mere plundering inroads on either
side of the border commonly were. <span class="sni">Its results.</span>
The direct results
of the warfare of this year were in truth the crowning
result of causes which had been working for a whole
generation. <span class="sni">Growth of the English power</span>
It was a singular irony of fate which made
William the Red in some sort a missionary, not only of
the political power of the English kingdom, but of the
ascendency of the English blood and speech. He began
the later position of England as an European power.
He extended the boundaries of the kingdom of England
within his own island. <span class="sni">and of the English nation under William Rufus.</span>
And, more than this, he gave
decisive help to a work which wrought one of the
greatest of victories, not so much for England as a
power as for the English-speaking folk in their English-speaking
character. That he gave kings to Scotland
was a small matter; that was done by other rulers of
England before and after him. What specially marks
his reign is that in his day, and largely by his agency,
it was ruled that, of the three elements in Northern
Britain, British, English, and Scottish or Irish, the English
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
element should have the upper hand. <span class="sni">The Scottish kingdom becomes English.</span>
It was ruled
that the kingdom of Scotland, whatever might be its
relations towards the kingdom of England, whether
separate or united, whether dependent or independent,
whether friendly or hostile, should be itself truly an
English kingdom, a kingdom which was for some
generations more truly English than the southern
England itself.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Summary of Scottish affairs.</span>
The Scottish affairs with which we shall have to deal
in the present chapter begin with the controversy between
William Rufus and Malcolm which led to the
death of Malcolm in his last invasion of England.
<span class="sni">Death of Malcolm; first reign of Donald. 1093.</span>
On
this follows that first outburst of the true Scottish nationality
which led to the election of Donald, followed by
his overthrow and the establishment of Duncan by the
power of England. <span class="sni">Reign of Duncan.</span>
Then, after a short interval, comes
the second national uprising, and the restoration of
Donald. After a longer interval comes the second
overthrow of Donald, and the establishment of the
younger Eadgar by the arms of the elder. <span class="sni">Second reign of Donald. 1094. Establishment of Eadgar. 1097.</span> The question
was now decided in favour of the line of Malcolm and
Margaret and of the form of English influence which
was represented by that line. And between these two
last revolutions we may record, as a kind of episode for
which it is not easy to find a place in the general run of
any other narrative, <span class="sni">Revolt of Robert of Mowbray. 1095.</span>
the revolt and overthrow of the great
earl of Northern England which forms at least a poetical
sequence to the overthrow of Malcolm. Between the
second establishment and the second overthrow of
Donald, I propose to tell, in its chronological order, the
tale of the slayers of Malcolm, of Earl Robert of Mowbray
and his kinsman Morel. There is little doubt that
their revolt was connected with movements in Normandy
also; but it would have been hard to describe it
in a chapter in which Anselm is the chief actor. It
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
comes better in its moral and geographical relation
towards the affairs of Scotland.</p>

<p>But Scotland was not the only land within the four
seas of Britain with which the kingdom of England has
much to do, especially in the way of fighting, within the
few years of this memorable reign. <span class="sni">Affairs of Wales.</span>
The affairs of Wales
are still more constantly coming before our eyes. While
the Red King is on the throne, Welsh warfare supplies,
year after year, no small part of the events which the
chronicler of England has to record. The Welsh history
of this time is one of deep interest on many grounds.
But it is specially important as giving us an example of
a third type of conquest in our own island, a conquest
differing widely both from the English Conquest of
Britain and from the Norman Conquest of England.
<span class="sni">Comparison between Wales and Scotland.</span>
Nor do the affairs of Wales fail to supply us with some
instructive contrasts as compared with the affairs of
Scotland. Scotland and the other dominions of the
Scottish king seem throughout this time to act as a
whole, at least as regards England. The land is conquered,
or it wins back its freedom; it receives foreign
influences, or it casts them out; but it seems to do all these
things as a whole. The union was perhaps very much on
the surface, but the events of this time bring whatever
there was of union to the front. <span class="sni">Disunion in Wales.</span>
The British story, on the
other hand, is the story of disunion in its strongest form.
Alike in victory and in defeat, all is local and personal;
common action on the part of the whole nation seems
impossible. The result of English dealings with Wales
during these years may be summed up as immediate loss
and final success, as defeat in detail leading to substantial
conquest. <span class="sni">Effects of the reign on the union of Britain.</span>
It is to this reign more than to any other that
we may trace up the beginning of the chain of events
which has gradually welded together England, Scotland,
and Wales, into the thoroughly united island of
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
Great Britain. The remote causes begin far earlier;
now we begin to enter on the actual story itself. And
from that story we may perhaps draw another lesson.
<span class="sni">Its causes.</span>
Three nations, differing in blood and speech, once parted
by bitter enmities, have been worked together into one
political whole, while still keeping so much of old diversity
as is really healthy, so much as hinders a dull and
lifeless uniformity, so much as sometimes kindles to
wholesome rivalry in a common cause. But this has
been because the facts of geography allowed and almost
compelled their union; it has been because the nature
of the old enmities was such as did not hinder union.
England, Scotland, and Wales, have at various times
done one another a good deal of mischief; there has
been no time when any one of the three held either of
the others in abiding Turkish bondage. But these very
facts may teach us that the same result cannot be looked
for in a land where the undying laws of nature and the
events of past history alike forbid it. Such union cannot
be where the boundaries of land and water on the map,
where the memory of abiding Turkish bondage in days
not long passed by, join to hinder the same process of
welding together which has so happily taken place among
the three nations of the isle of Britain. <span class="sni">Comparison with Ireland and Normandy.</span>
William the Red
did much for the final union of Britain, because nature
favoured that union. He brought Normandy under the
same rule as England, but only for the two lands to be
again parted asunder, because nature forbad their union.
And if it be true that from the rocks of Saint David’s
he looked out on the dim outline of distant Ireland, he
did well to turn away from the prospect, to bluster and
threaten, it may be, but to keep the practical exercise of
his warfare and his policy for other lands. He did well to
keep it, as far as the island world was concerned, for
those lands which, as the event has shown, nature did
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
not forbid to be, in course of ages, fully united with his
kingdom.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§ 1. <span class="title">The Last Year of Malcolm.</span><br />1093.</p>

<p>We should be glad of a clearer account than we have
of the immediate causes which led to the open breach
between William and Malcolm in the year which followed
the restoration of Carlisle. <span class="sni">Complaints made by Malcolm.</span>
It is certain that
Malcolm complained through an embassy that the King
of the English had failed to carry out the provisions of
the treaty made two years before. Nothing is more
likely; it was not the manner of William Rufus to carry
out his treaties with other princes, any more than his
promises to his subjects. Both alike, being parts of his
everyday duty, and not lighted up with the rays of
chivalrous honour, were reckoned by him under the head
of those promises which no man can carry out. But we
should be well pleased to know whether the alleged
breach of treaty had anything to do with William’s
Cumbrian conquest. <span class="sni">Effects on Scotland of the restoration of Carlisle.</span>
The strengthening of Carlisle, the
annexation of its district, could in no case have been
agreeable to the King of Scots. And if, as there seems
every reason to believe, the land had been held by its
late lord Dolfin as a vassal of the Scottish crown, what
William had done was a distinct aggression on the rights
of that crown. <span class="sni">Probable wrong to Scotland.</span>
The superiority of the English crown
over both Scotland and Cumberland would in no way
justify the act; it would have been a wrong done to the
Duke of the Normans if the King of the French had
annexed Ponthieu and strengthened Saint Valery against
Normandy. <span class="sni">Other grounds of offence.</span>
But we are not told whether this was the
ground of offence, or whether William had failed to carry
out any of the clauses of the treaty, those for instance
which secured to the King of Scots certain payments
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
and possessions in England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
What followed may perhaps
suggest that, however much the occupation of Carlisle
may have rankled in the mind of Malcolm, the formal
ground of complaint was something of this last kind.
<span class="sni">Scottish embassy at Gloucester. March, 1093.</span>
Whatever were his wrongs, the Scottish king sent to
complain of them, and the answer which he received was
one which shows that, at this first stage, Rufus was not
disposed to slight the complaint. We are not told the
exact date of this first Scottish embassy. It may very
well have come during the short season of William’s
reformation; his seeming readiness to deal reasonably
with the matter, as contrasted with his conduct a few
months later, may pass as one of the fruits of his temporary
penitence, along with the appointment of Anselm
and the promise of good laws. <span class="sni">Malcolm summoned to Gloucester.</span>
He sent an embassy to
Scotland, inviting or summoning the Scottish King to
Gloucester, and giving hostages for his safety. This looks
very much as if the ground of complaint was the refusal
of some of the rights which had been promised to Malcolm
whenever he came to the English court. The Scottish
King agreed to come on these terms. William, in his
present frame of mind, was seemingly anxious to do all
honour to the prince with whom he was dealing. <span class="sni">Eadgar sent to bring him.</span>
The
Scottish ambassadors were sent back to bring their king,
and with them, as the most fitting of mediators, was sent
the man who had himself for a moment been a king,
the brother-in-law of Malcolm, the favoured guest of
William, the Ætheling Eadgar.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Eadgar in favour with William.</span>
We last heard of Eadgar somewhat more than a year
before, when Robert left England in anger, and Eadgar
went with him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
This seems to imply that the relations
between William and Eadgar were at that moment unfriendly.

We have no account of Eadgar’s return to
England; but the duty on which he was now sent implies
that he was now not only in William’s formal favour, but
in his real confidence. <span class="sni">His mission to Scotland.</span>
He who had lately been Malcolm’s
representative in a conference with William now acts as
William’s representative in a conference with Malcolm.
Eadgar, like his friend Duke Robert, was clearly one of
those men who can act better on behalf of others than on
behalf of themselves.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
In his present mission he seems
to have acquitted himself to William’s full satisfaction;
the King of Scots was persuaded to come to the English
court. If his coming did not prove specially lucky either
to himself or to the over-lord to whom he came, that was
at all events not the fault of Eadgar.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Events of the year 1093.</span>
While Eadgar was away on his mission to Scotland,
he left behind him a busy state of things in England.
His embassy came in the midst of the long delays between
Anselm’s first nomination and his investiture, enthronement,
and consecration. It came in the time when William
of Eu was plotting,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
and when, as we shall presently
see, seeming conquest was going on throughout Wales.
<span class="sni">Meeting at Gloucester. August 24, 1093.</span>
The place and day for which Malcolm was summoned to
the King’s court was Gloucester on the feast of Saint
Bartholomew. This can hardly have been a forestalling
of the regular Christmas Gemót, for which, by the rule
of the last reign, Gloucester was the proper place. But
this year, like most years when William Rufus was in
England, was a year of meetings. This cannot be the
meeting at which Anselm was invested and did homage,
for that, as we have seen, was at Winchester.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
But, if
Winchester was near to the New Forest, Gloucester was
near to the Forest of Dean, and would on that account
not be without its attractions for the Red King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span>
Or it
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
may well be that the presence of the King at Gloucester,
both now and earlier in the year, may have been caused
by the convenience of that city for assemblies in which
action against the Britons might have to be discussed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>

<span class="sni">Malcolm sets forth. August, 1093.</span>
Malcolm accordingly set forth, “with mickle worship,”
in the beginning of August as it would seem, to go to
the court of the over-lord by the Severn.</p>

<p><span class="sni">He stops at Durham.</span>
On his way he tarried to take part in a great ecclesiastical
ceremony, his share in which was not without a
political meaning. <span class="sni">Rebuilding of the abbey.</span>
The Bishop of Durham, William of
Saint-Calais, now again the King’s chief counsellor,
already his partisan in the opening strife with Anselm,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
was ready to begin his great work of rebuilding Saint
Cuthberht’s abbey. The church of Ealdhun, which had
escaped the flames on the day of Robert of Comines,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>
could not really have been ruinous beyond repair; but,
after the fashion of the time, it was doomed to make way
for a building, built not only on a vaster scale, but in an
improved form of art surpassing every contemporary
building.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Malcolm lays a foundation stone. August 11, 1093.</span>
Of the mighty pile which still stands, the glory
of the Northern Romanesque, King Malcolm now laid
one of the foundation-stones, along with Bishop William
and Prior Turgot.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span>
The invitation to take part in such
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
a work was clearly meant as a mark of honour and
friendship on both sides. But it must surely have
meant more. The King of Scots could not on any
showing have claimed any authority at Durham. But
he was something more than a mere foreign visitor. As
ecclesiastical geography was understood at Durham,
Malcolm was no stranger there; he was rather quite at
home. At York he might have been told that the whole
of his dominions owed spiritual allegiance to that metropolis.
But the Bishops of Durham, practically the
only suffragans of the see of York and suffragans almost
on a level with their metropolitan, were at no time
specially zealous for the rights of the Northern Primate.
<span class="sni">Much of Malcolm’s dominions in Durham diocese.</span>
But, as they drew the ecclesiastical map, a great part of
Malcolm’s dominions, his earldom of Lothian, his Castle
of the Maidens, perhaps even lands beyond those borders,
all came within their own immediate spiritual charge.
To the counsellor of King William Malcolm came as the
highest vassal of the English crown; to the Bishop of
Durham he came as the highest layman in his own diocese.
As such, he was fittingly asked to take a share in
a work which concerned the kingdom and the church
of which he was one of the chief members. <span class="sni">Import of the ceremony.</span>
His consent,
besides being a mark of friendship alike towards King
William and Bishop William, was doubtless taken as
an acknowledgement that he belonged to the temporal
realm of the one and to the spiritual fold of the other.
And if Malcolm had learned any of the subtleties of
some of his contemporaries and of some of his successors,
he might have comforted himself with the thought that,
whatever the laying of the stone implied, it was laid
only by the Earl of Lothian and not by the King of
Scots.</p>

<p class="p2">From Durham and its ceremonies Malcolm, Earl and
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>
King, went on to the court of the over-lord at Gloucester.
<span class="sni">Malcolm at Gloucester. August 24, 1093.</span>
He had evidently come disposed to make the best of
matters, as William himself had been during his time of
sickness and penitence. But now in August Rufus
was himself again; he had repented of his repentance;
he was more than ever puffed up with pride and with
the feeling of his own power. <span class="sni">Rufus refuses to see Malcolm.</span>
Out of mere insolence, it
would seem, in defiance of the advice of his counsellors
who wished for peace, he refused to have any speech
with, or even to see, the royal vassal and guest who had
made such a journey to come to his presence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
Whatever
passed between the kings must have passed by way
of message through third parties. <span class="sni">Dispute between the kings.</span>
In one account we
read generally that Rufus would do nothing of what he
had promised to Malcolm.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span>
In another version we are
told, with all the precision of legal language, that William
<span class="sni">Question of “doing right.”</span>
demanded that Malcolm should “do right” to him
by the judgement of the barons of England only, while
Malcolm maintained that he was bound by ancient
custom to “do right” only on the borders of the two
kingdoms, where the kings of Scots were wont to “do
right” to the kings of the English, and that by the
judgement of the great men of both kingdoms.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
The
meaning of these words is plainly open to dispute, and
it has naturally given rise to not a little.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Probable pretensions of Rufus.</span>
Their most
natural meaning seems to be that William wished to deal
with the kingdom of Scotland as with an ordinary fief.
Such a claim would have been against all precedent, and
it would be specially dangerous when William Rufus was
king and when Randolf Flambard was his minister. On
the other hand, Malcolm in no way denies the superiority
of the English crown; he stands simply on the ground of
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
ancient custom. He is ready to “do right,” a process
clearly to be done by an inferior to a superior; but he
will do it only as by ancient custom it was wont to be
done. Because a kingdom acknowledged the external
superiority of another kingdom, it did not at all follow
that its king was bound to submit himself to the judgement
of the barons of the superior kingdom. The original
commendation had been made, not only by the King of
Scots, but by the whole Scottish people,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span>
and their king
might fairly claim that he should have the advice and help
of his own Wise Men in making answer to any charge
that was brought against him. This is one of the cases
in which the use of technical language, without any full
explanation of the circumstances, really makes a matter
darker; and we must perhaps be content to leave the
exact point at issue unsettled. <span class="sni">William in the wrong.</span>
But it is plain from the
English Chronicle that William was in the wrong; he
refused to do something for Malcolm which he had promised
to do. The obligations of a treaty sat lightly on
the Red King; but on one point his honour was pledged.
Malcolm had come under a safe-conduct&mdash;&#8203;the sending of
hostages, if nothing else, shows it. <span class="sni">William observes his safe-conduct.</span>
And a safe-conduct
from Rufus might always be trusted. We cannot say
that the two kings parted in wrath, seeing they did not
meet at all. But Malcolm naturally went away in great
wrath, and he left Rufus behind him in great wrath also.
He reached his own kingdom in safety; what he did
with the hostages we are not told.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The silly pride shown by William Rufus at Gloucester
led to a series of events of the highest importance both
as to the relations between England and Scotland, and
as to the internal affairs of the northern kingdom.
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
<span class="sni">Malcolm’s last invasion of England.</span>
As soon as Malcolm reached Scotland, he gathered together
his forces, and began his fifth, and, as it happened,
his last, invasion of England. He entered the
earldom of Northumberland, and harried after his usual
fashion as far as some point which, there is no reason to
doubt, was in the near neighbourhood of Alnwick. <span class="sni">He draws near to Alnwick.</span>
We
may fairly accept the tradition which carries him to the
spot known as Malcolm’s Cross, where a commemorative
rood once stood, and where the ruins of a Romanesque
chapel may still be seen. The spot is on high ground
overlooking the river Alne, while on the opposite side of
the stream a lower height is crowned by the town of
<span class="sni">Alnwick castle.</span>
Alnwick, and by such remains of its famous castle as
modern innovation has spared. The neighbourhood of
<span class="sni">Alnwick and the Percies.</span>
that castle, the fame of the historic house which once
held it, has caused every place and every act into which
the name of Alnwick or of Percy can be dragged to be
surrounded by an atmosphere of legend. <span class="sni">The first Percy at Alnwick. 1309.</span>
It needs some
little effort to take in the fact that, as the Percies of
history have long passed away from Alnwick, so in the
days of Malcolm some centuries had to pass before the
Percies of history reached Alnwick. It needs some further
effort to take in the further fact that the true Percy,
<span class="sni">The true Percies.</span>
the Percy of Domesday, the Percy of Yorkshire, never
had anything to do with Alnwick or with Northumberland
at all. And it perhaps needs a further effort again
to take in the fact that it is by no means clear whether
in the days of Malcolm there was any castle of Alnwick
in being. One may guess that the site had been fortified
at some earlier time; <span class="sni">The Vescies at Alnwick.</span>
but the known history of Alnwick,
castle and abbey, begins with the works of the elder lords of
Alnwick, the house of Vescy, in the next century.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
Of that
date a noble gateway has still been spared, which may
<span class="sni">1174.</span>
well have looked on the captivity of the Scottish William
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
in the days of Henry the Second, but which assuredly
did not look on the death of Malcolm in the days of
the Red King. The height to which Malcolm’s harryings
reached may have looked down on some earlier fortress
beyond the Alne, or it may simply have looked down on
the town of Alnwick, which was doubtless already in
being. But whatever was there at that time in the
way of artificial defence, there were stout hearts and
a wary leader ready to meet the king who was invading
England for the fifth time.</p>

<p><span class="sni">English feeling about Malcolm.</span>
It is certainly strange that in not a few English
writers, generally indeed those who are parted from
the event by some distance of time and place, the
overthrow of the invaders which now followed is told
with a certain feeling for the invader and with a certain
feeling against those who overthrew him. Malcolm
perhaps drew to himself some share of the national and
religious halo which gathered round his wife, while
there was nothing attractive, either on national or on
personal grounds, in the men who at that time stood forth
as the champions of England. Yet it must have been
the “good men” of two years past<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span>
who now went forth
under the cunning guidance of Earl Robert of Mowbray.
By some ambush or other stratagem, that skilful captain
led his forces on the Scottish King unawares, under
circumstances which are not detailed, but which have
led even English writers to speak of the attack as
treacherous.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Death of Malcolm. November 13, 1093.</span>
Malcolm was killed; and with him died
his son and expected heir Eadward. They fell on the day
of Saint Brice, ninety-one years after the great slaughter
of the Danes which has made that day memorable
in the kalendar of England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Malcolm slain by Morel.</span>
The actual slayer of
Malcolm was his gossip Morel, Earl Robert’s nephew
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
and steward, guardian of the rock and fortress of
Bamburgh. From him it would seem that Alnwick,
or perhaps rather the dale between Alnwick and Malcolm’s
Cross, took the name of <span class="title">Moreldene</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span>
Morel was,
it was noticed, the gossip, the <em>compater</em>, of Malcolm, as
William Malet was of Harold;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span>
and it seems almost
to be implied, by writers far away from Alnwick, that
this spiritual affinity made the slaughter of the invader
a crime.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Burial of Malcolm at Tynemouth.</span>
The body of Malcolm, like the bodies of Harold and
Waltheof, received a first burial and a later translation.
It was first borne to the church of Saint Oswine at Tynemouth,
a place which was growing into great reputation
under the special favour of Earl Robert. <span class="sni">History of Tynemouth.</span>
Through his
bounty the walls of a new minster were rising within his
fortress which crowned the rocky height on the left bank
of the mouth of the great Northumbrian river. That fortress
and that minster will again play a memorable part
in the chequered history of their founder. But the church
of Saint Oswine, the martyred King of Deira, did not
owe its first origin to Robert of Mowbray or to any
other stranger.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Martyrdom of King Oswine.</span>
The body of the sainted king, slain
by the practice of the Bretwalda Oswin, was laid in
a church which was said to have been first built of wood
by the Bretwalda Eadwine, and then rebuilt of stone
by the sainted Bretwalda Oswald. <span class="sni">First church of Tynemouth.</span>
The position of
Tynemouth marked it out as a special point for attack
and defence in the days of the Danish invasions; but,
after the havoc which they caused, the holy place had
been neglected and forgotten. <span class="sni">Invention of Saint Oswine. March 15, 1065.</span>
In the days of Earl Tostig
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
and Bishop Æthelwine the pious care of the Earl’s
wife Judith had led to the invention of the martyr’s
relics, and to the beginning of a new church. Of that
<span class="sni">Tostig begins the new church.</span>
church Tostig laid the foundations in the year of his fall,
but men of another speech were to finish it. The unfinished
church was granted by Earl Waltheof to the monks
of the newly restored house of Jarrow, and his gift was
confirmed by the Norman Earl Alberic. <span class="sni">Tynemouth granted to Jarrow by Waltheof.</span>
A gift to Jarrow
proved, as events turned out, to be the same thing
as a gift to Durham; but, before the change of foundation
at Durham, the monks of Jarrow had removed the relics
of Saint Oswine from Tynemouth to their own church.
<span class="sni">Earl Robert grants Tynemouth to Saint Alban’s.</span>
With the reign of Earl Robert a change came. Out
of devotion, and at the heavenly bidding, as was believed
at Saint Alban’s&mdash;&#8203;out of a quarrel with Bishop William,
as was believed at Durham&mdash;&#8203;but at all events out of
a feeling for the memory of Oswine which showed that
he had learned some reverence for the worthies of the
land in which he had settled&mdash;&#8203;Earl Robert deprived
the church of Durham of this possession, and refounded
Tynemouth as a cell to the distant abbey of
Saint Alban. <span class="sni">Death of Abbot Paul. 1093.</span>
Abbot Paul came in person to take
possession, in defiance of all protests on behalf of
Durham, where it was believed that his death which
soon followed was the punishment of this wrong. <span class="sni">Translation of Saint Oswine. August 23, 1103.</span>
Saint
Oswine himself was not translated back to Tynemouth
till the power of Robert of Mowbray had passed away.
But the church on the rock became famous, and it fills
a considerable place in the local history of Saint Alban’s.
There, in the chosen sanctuary of his conqueror, the
body of Malcolm lay for awhile. <span class="sni">Malcolm translated to Dunfermline.</span>
He was afterwards
moved to his own Dunfermline<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>
, where the pillars of his
minster, in their deep channellings, bear witness to an
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
abiding tie, at least of the artistic kind, between the
royal abbey of Scotland and the great church of Northern
England of which a Scottish king laid the foundation-stone.</p>

<p>But, if English writers in later times, and even men
who wrote at the time in distant parts of England,
found some flowers to strew on the tomb of the husband
of the saintly daughter of the old kingly line, no such
feelings were shared by those who had seen Malcolm
and his invading host at their own doors. <span class="sni">Local estimate of Malcolm’s death.</span>
The chronicler
who wrote nearest to the spot stops, as he records the
death of Malcolm, to mark the judgement of God which
cut off the merciless enemy of England. He stops to
reckon up all the times that Malcolm had laid waste
the fields of Northumberland, and had carried away the
folk of Northumberland into bondage.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span>
He tells with
glee how the invading host utterly vanished; how they
were either cut down by the sword of the avenger, or
swept away by the floods of Alne, swollen by the winter’s
rain beyond its wonted depth and strength.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span>
He records
the burial at Tynemouth; but he takes care to tell how
none of the Scottish host was left to bury the Scottish
king, but how the charity of two men of the land bore
him on a wain to the place of burial.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_31" id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span>
And he adds
the moral, equally applicable to all ambitious kings, that
he who had deprived so many of life and goods and
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
freedom now, by God’s just judgement, lost his life and
his goods together.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The invading king was dead, and with him the son
whom he had designed to wear his crown after him was
dead also. The saintly wife of Malcolm and mother of
Eadward was soon to follow her husband and her son.
<span class="sni">Character of Margaret.</span>
Of the true holiness of Margaret, of her zeal, not only
for a formal devotion, but for all that is morally right,
none can doubt.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_33" id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span>
A woman evidently of great natural
gifts and of a cultivation unusual in her time, she deeply
impressed all whom she came across, her own husband
most of all. <span class="sni">Malcolm’s devotion to her.</span>
To Malcolm his Margaret was indeed a
pearl of great price, to be cherished, almost to be worshipped,
as already a saint on earth. She taught him
to share her devotions, till men wondered at such piety
in a man of this world.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span>
It is touching to read how
the unlettered king loved to look with wonder on the
books in which his queen delighted; how those which
she delighted in more than others he would cherish and
kiss like holy relics, how he would have them adorned
with gold and gems, and would then bring them back
to his wife in their new splendour, as sacred offerings.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span>
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
Her prayers, her fasts, her never-failing bounty to the
poor, stand out in her biography even more conspicuously
than her gifts to churches, to distant Iona among them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>

<span class="sni">Margaret’s education of her children.</span>
It is perhaps a rarer merit that the influence of her
personal example hindered the slightest approach to foul
or profane speech in her presence,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span>
and that her careful
education of her children handed on her virtues to
another generation. For Margaret was not one of those
who sought for their own soul’s health in neglecting the
most obvious duties of the state of life to which God
had called them. In the petty and selfish devotion of
her great-uncle she had no share; called to be wife,
mother, and queen, it was by doing her duty as wife,
mother, and queen that she won her claim to a higher
saintship than that of Æthelthryth at Ely or of Eadgyth
at Wilton. The witness of Margaret is in her children,
children many of whom bore the great and kingly names
of her own house. The careful training which the
Conqueror gave to his children showed its fruits in his
daughters only; the teaching of Margaret lived in her
sons as well. <span class="sni">Her sons;</span>
Eadward died with his father; but in
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
Eadgar and Alexander and the more renowned David,
she gave three kings to Scotland, of whom the two latter
were kings indeed, while all three inherited the gentleness
and piety of their mother, along with the virtue
so rare among the princes of that day, the strictest
purity of personal life.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">David;</span>
David, son-in-law of Waltheof,
who gave Scotland worthy heirs to succeed him, surely
ranks higher on the roll of royal saints than Eadward,
son-in-law of Godwine, who left England to the chances
of a disputed succession. One child only of this goodly
stock is spoken of as falling away from the bright
example of his parent.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Eadmund.</span>
Yet Eadmund, alone of the
children of Margaret, lived to become a cloistered monk;
and he was perhaps deemed degenerate only because
he fell back on the character of a Scottish patriot of
an older type.</p>

<p>Had Margaret confined her cares to bringing up her
own children in strict piety and virtue, one of her sons
would in all likelihood have mounted his father’s throne
immediately after the bloody day of Alnwick. <span class="sni">Margaret’s reforms.</span>
But in
Malcolm’s kingdom she came, in her own eyes at least,
as the representative of a higher morality, a purer religion,
and a more advanced civilization, and she felt
specially called on to play the part of a reformer. <span class="sni">State of religion in Scotland.</span>
The
ecclesiastical condition of Scotland was by no means
perfect, according to the standard which Margaret had
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">23</span>
brought with her. The Scots still kept Easter at a
wrong time; they said mass in some way which at
Durham was deemed barbarous;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span>
they cared not for the
Lord’s day; and they are said to have neglected the
most ordinary Christian rules in the matter of marriage.
They took to wife, after Jewish models, the widows of
their brothers, and even, after old Teutonic models, the
widows of their fathers. All these evils, ecclesiastical
and moral, Margaret set herself zealously to root out.
Councils were gathered to work the needful reforms, and
<span class="sni">Malcolm acts as his wife’s interpreter.</span>
Margaret found her husband an useful interpreter. For
the king who had been placed on the Scottish throne
by the will of Eadward and the arms of Siward naturally
spoke the English tongue as readily as that of his own
people.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>
But Margaret was a queen as well as a saint;
and she either took a personal pleasure in the pomp of
royalty or else she deemed royal state to be wholesome
in its effects on the minds of the barbarous people. <span class="sni">She increases the pomp of the Scottish court.</span>
The
King of Scots was taught to show himself in more
gorgeous apparel, to ride with a greater and more stately
train, than his forefathers had been wont to do. But the
righteous queen knew something of the evils which
might come of a king’s great and stately following, and
she took care that the train of King Malcolm should
not, like the train of King William, pass among the
fields and households of his people like a blight or a
pestilence<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span>
. That Margaret should innovate in the
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>
direction of state and ceremony was not wonderful.
<span class="sni">Her early associations.</span>
Daughter of kings, kinswoman, perhaps daughter, of
Cæsars, she had, in her childhood and youth, seen something
of many lands. She may have seen the crown
of Saint Stephen, still in its freshness, on the brow of
a Magyar king, and the crown of Charles and Otto on
the brow of an Imperial kinsman. She had assuredly
seen King Eadward, King Harold, and King William,
in all the glory of the crown to which her husband’s
crown owed homage. And we may be sure that the
kingly state of Scotland was mean besides that of
Germany, of England, and even of Hungary. Margaret
might well think it a duty to herself and to her husband
to raise him in outward things nearer to a level with
his brother kings both of the island and of the mainland.
<span class="sni">Feeling of the Scots.</span>
But the policy of such a course, among such a people
as the Scots of that age, may well be doubted. A fierce
race, hard to control at any time, may well have had
no great love for an outward show of kingship, which
would be taken, and rightly, as the sign of a growth
of the kingly power such as agreed neither with their
customs nor with their wishes.</p>

<p><span class="sni">English influence in Scotland.</span>
Margaret moreover was a stranger in Scotland. One
can well believe that the native Scots were already
beginning to be jealous of English influence in any shape.
Before Margaret came, they must have felt that the
English element in the triple dominion was growing into
greater importance than their own. Lothian was becoming
greater than the true Scottish land beyond the Scots’-water.
Fife, it may well be, was already becoming as
Lothian. Malcolm himself had been placed on the throne
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
by English arms; he had become the man of two kings
who were politically English, though they held England
as a conquered realm. His five invasions of England
must have been quite needful to keep up even Malcolm’s
character among his own people. <span class="sni">Scottish feeling towards Margaret.</span>
And his English queen,
bringing in English ways, trying to turn Scotland into
another England, stopping good old Scottish customs
and good old Scottish licence, tricking out the King
of Albanach in some new devised foreign garb, English,
Norman, German, or Hungarian, must have been looked
at in her own time, by the Scots of her own day, with
very different feelings towards the living queen from
those with which they soon learned to look towards the
national saint. <span class="sni">English and Norman settlers.</span>
She came too with her English following,
and her English following was only the first wave of
many which came to strengthen the English element
which was already strong in the land. While Malcolm
and Margaret reigned, Scotland, the land which had
sheltered Margaret and her house in their days of
banishment, stood open to receive, and its king’s court
stood open to welcome, every comer from the south.
Native Englishmen flying from Norman oppression and
Norman plunder,&mdash;&#8203;Normans who thought that their share
in the plunder of England was too small&mdash;&#8203;men of both
races, of both tongues, of every class and rank among
the two races,&mdash;&#8203;all found a settlement across the Scottish
border. The King spoke English; the Queen most
likely spoke French also; Englishmen and Normans
alike seemed civilizing elements among the people whom
Margaret had to polish and to convert. Both Normans
and English kept Easter at the right time, and neither
Normans nor English thought of marrying their step-mothers.
Scotland and the court of Scotland were
crowded with English and Norman knights, with English
and Norman clerks. They got benefices, temporal and
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
spiritual, in the Scottish land. They may have converted;
they may have civilized; but conversion and
civilization are processes which are not always specially
delighted in by those who are to be converted and
civilized. Anyhow they were strangers, brought into
the land by kingly favour, to flourish, as men would
naturally deem, at the cost of the sons of the soil.
<span class="sni">Jealousy of the native Scots.</span>
The national spirit of the Scottish people arose; the jealousy
of the strangers established in the land waxed stronger
and stronger. It might be in some measure kept down as
long as novelty was embodied in the persons of the warrior
king and the holy queen. As soon as they were gone,
the pent-up torrent burst forth in its full strength.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">The news of Malcolm’s death brought to Margaret. November 17, 1093.</span>
The first to bring the news of the death of her husband
and son to the ears of Margaret was another of her
sons, the future King Eadgar. As the tale reached
Peterborough, Worcester, and Saint Evroul, the Queen,
when she heard the tidings, became as one dead at heart;
she settled her temporal affairs; she gave gifts to the
poor; then she entered the church with her chaplain;
she communicated at the mass which he sang; she prayed
that her soul might pass away, and her prayer was
granted.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_43" id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">English version of her death.</span>
This is a version which has already received
a legendary element. It is not, strictly speaking, miraculous,
but is on the way to become so. A person,
seemingly in health, is made to die in answer to prayer
on the receipt of ill news. The tale, as told by an
eye-witness, is different. The Queen had long been
expecting death; for half a year she had never mounted
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">27</span>
a horse, and had but seldom left her bed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_44" id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span>
On the fourth day
after her husband’s death, feeling somewhat stronger, <span class="sni">Turgot’s version.</span>
she
went into her private oratory; she heard mass, and communicated.
Her sickness increased; she was taken back to
her bed, holding and kissing<a name="cross" id="cross"></a> a relic known as the Black
Cross of Scotland,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_45" id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span>
and waiting for her end. She prayed
and repeated the fifty-first psalm,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_46" id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span>
with the cross in her
hand. The agony was already near when Eadgar came
from the war. She was able to ask after his father and
brother. Fearing to distress his mother yet more, Eadgar
said that they were well.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_47" id="fnanchor_47"></a><a href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span>
Margaret conjured him as
her son, and by the cross which she had in her hand,
to speak the truth. He then told her the grievous tale.
She murmured not, nor sinned with her lips.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_48" id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span>
She could
even give thanks for her sorrows, sent, as she deemed,
to cleanse her from her sins.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_49" id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span>
As one who had just
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
partaken of the holy rite, she began the prayer which
follows communion, and, as she prayed, her soul left the
world. The deadly paleness passed away from her face,
and she lay, red and white, as one sleeping.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_50" id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Her burial at Dunfermline.</span>
The place
of her death was Edinburgh, the castle of maidens;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_51" id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span>
her
body was borne to Dunfermline and buried there, before
the altar of the church of the Holy Trinity of her own
rearing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_52" id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">We read the touching tale with different feelings from
those with which it was heard at the moment by Scots
who clave to old Scottish ways, good or bad. We have
even hints that the funeral of the sainted queen could
not go from Edinburgh to Dunfermline without danger.
<span class="sni">Scottish feeling towards her.</span>
It needed either a miracle or the natural phænomena
of the country to enable the body of the English lady
to be carried out of one gate of the Castle of the
Maidens, while the champions of the old times of Scotland
were thundering at another.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_53" id="fnanchor_53"></a><a href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span>
Such a story may
be legendary in its details, but it is clearly no legend,
but true tradition, as regards the national feeling of the
times which it describes. Scotland, at the time of
Malcolm’s death, was still torn by local and dynastic
factions;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span>
but all parties in the old Scottish realm were
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
agreed on one point. <span class="sni">A Scottish king to be chosen.</span>
They would have no more innovations
from England or from Normandy; they would
have no more English or Norman strangers to eat up
their land in their own sight. They would have no
son of Margaret, no son even of Malcolm, to reign over
them; they would again have a king of the true stock
of Albanach, who should reign after the old ways of
Albanach and none other. The settled English element
south of the Scots’-water would be weak against such
a movement as this; or indeed it may be that the men
of Lothian were no more eager to be reformed after
Margaret’s fashion than the men of Scotland and Strathclyde.
<span class="sni">Election of Donald.</span>
Such a king as was needed was soon found in
the person of Donald Bane, Donald the Red&mdash;&#8203;Scotland
had her Rufus as well as England&mdash;&#8203;the brother of the
late king and son of that Duncan who had been cut off
in his youth in the civil war between his house and the
house of Macbeth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_55" id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span>
He was at once raised to the Scottish
crown as the representative of Scottish nationality.
<span class="sni">He drives out the English.</span>
His first act was emphatic; “he drave out all the
English that ere with the King Malcolm were.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_56" id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Meaning of the words.</span>
This is of course no more to be understood of a general
driving out of the settled English inhabitants of Lothian
than the massacre of Saint Brice is to be understood of
a general slaughter of the settled Danish inhabitants
of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_57" id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span>
The driving out was
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
confined to the newly come English, who filled the court
of Malcolm and Margaret, and who doubtless kept, or
seemed to keep, many a true-born Scot from the favour
of his king. For these there was to be no longer a
place in the Scottish realm or in the other dominions of
its sovereign. They had to go and seek shelter in their
own land. The language of our guides suggests that
they were mainly English in the strictest sense; though
we cannot but fancy that some Normans or other
strangers may have crept in among them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_58" id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span>
One thing
is certain; among the English that ere with the King
Malcolm were his own children by his English wife
held a place. <span class="sni">Margaret’s children driven out.</span>
Of his sons Eadmund and Æthelred we
cannot speak with certainty; but Eadgar, Alexander,
and David, had to flee, and the Scottish story describes
their uncle the Ætheling Eadgar as in some way helping
their escape. He did it, we are told, by stealth, that he
might not kindle any suspicion in the Norman King of
England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_59" id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Action of the elder Eadgar.</span>
It is hard to see what Eadgar, who could
not have been in Scotland at the time of his sister’s
death, could have done for her children till they were at
least within the English border, and there is nothing to
make us think that Eadgar had in any way lost that
full favour with William Rufus which he had enjoyed at
the beginning of the year. But the mere use of his name
witnesses to the belief that he who could do so little for
himself was able to do a good deal for others. In this
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
story he is said to have sheltered his sister’s daughters
as well as her sons. <span class="sni">Malcolm’s daughters;</span>
More trustworthy accounts say
that Eadgyth and Mary had already been sent by their
parents to be brought up in the abbey of Romsey, where
their aunt Christina was a nun.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_60" id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Mary;</span>
Mary in time married
the younger Eustace of Boulogne, and was the mother of
a Queen of the English, that valiant Matilda who strove
so well to keep the English crown for her husband
Stephen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_61" id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Eadgyth or Matilda;</span>

That was not to be her fate;
neither was it to be her fate to embrace the holy calling
which her aunt Christina strove to force upon her. <span class="sni">her sojourn at Romsey.</span>
For
the present she remained unprofessed, loathing the veil

When

 <span class="sni">Malcolm at Romsey.</span>
Her father
too, on some visit to England&mdash;&#8203;could he have turned
aside to Romsey before or after his memorable visit to
Gloucester?&mdash;&#8203;saw the veil on her head with anger; he had
not designed her for that, but for the bridal of Count
Alan. <span class="sni">Her relations with Henry.</span>
It seems plain that her marriage with Henry
was a marriage of old affection on both sides, and one
version even makes the Ætheling seek for her as his
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
wife in her father’s lifetime. <span class="sni">Tale of Eadgyth and William Rufus.</span>
One version, strange indeed,
but perhaps the more likely to have some truth in
it because of its strangeness, gives her an unlooked-for
lover. We are told that, for once, in the person of Eadgyth
of Scotland, female charms kindled in the heart of the Red
King a passion which in his case might be called virtuous.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_66" id="fnanchor_66"></a><a href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span>
He came to Romsey with a body of his knights;
the wily abbess, dreading his purpose, caused Eadgyth
to put on the veil. She then drew the King into the
cloister to see her roses and other flowers; but he caught
a glimpse of the nuns as they passed by; he saw the
veil on the head of Eadgyth, and turned away. She
was then twelve years old. Presently her father came;
he saw her veiled; he tore the veil from her head, he
trampled it under his feet, and took away his daughter.
Such a tale must be taken for what it is worth; but the
picture of William Rufus contemplating either maidens
or roses at least puts him in a light in which we do not
meet him elsewhere.</p>

<p class="p2">A series of events now follow which our guides seem
to place within the year of Malcolm’s death, but for
which room can hardly have been found in the few
weeks of it which were still to come. <span class="sni">Christmas, 1093&ndash;1094.</span>
The winter of
that year, it will be remembered, was a stirring winter.
It saw the consecration of Anselm; it saw the Gemót at
Gloucester at which William received the challenge from
his brother in Normandy;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_67" id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span>
it saw the first beginnings
of fresh disputes between the King and the Archbishop.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_68" id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span>

<span class="sni">Events of 1094.</span>
The next year was the year of William’s second Norman
expedition, and it is clear that his absence from England
had an influence on the affairs of Scotland, as it undoubtedly
had on those of Wales. <span class="sni">Order of Scottish events.</span>
The election of
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
Donald and the driving out of the English from Scotland
may have followed as swiftly on the deaths of
Malcolm and Margaret as the election of Harold followed
on the death of Eadward or the election of Henry
on the death of William Rufus. But we can hardly find
room for an English expedition to Scotland, for the
establishment of a new king, and for a domestic revolution
limiting his powers, between the driving out of the
English and the last day of the year. One is inclined
to think that the Gemót of Gloucester saw a discussion
of the affairs of Scotland as well as of the affairs of
Normandy, and that the results of that discussion, direct
consequences as they were of the death of Malcolm and
the election of Donald, were set down under the year
in which the chain of events began, though some of them
must, almost in the nature of things, have really happened
in the year which followed.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Gemót of Gloucester. Christmas, 1093&ndash;1094.</span>
I am inclined therefore to think that it must have been
at the Christmas assembly which decreed the war with
Robert that a claimant appeared to demand the Scottish
crown at the hands of the southern over-lord. This was
Duncan, the son of Malcolm and Ingebiorg. <span class="sni">Duncan claims the Scottish crown.</span>
He was in
truth the eldest of Malcolm’s children, and, though, under
the influence of a new set of ideas, it became usual to
speak of him as a kind of Ishmael, he was most likely as
lawful an heir to the Scottish throne as any of the three
kings who were sons of the English saint.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_69" id="fnanchor_69"></a><a href="#footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span>
In itself
the succession of Duncan would have seemed an intermediate
course between the succession of Donald and
the succession of Margaret’s son Eadgar. But Duncan,
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
given years ago as a hostage to William the Great,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_70" id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span>
had
long been a follower of William the Red. <span class="sni">Duncan’s Norman education.</span>
He lived in
his court, and did him faithful service as his man and his
knight. He must have been unknown in Scotland, and
his feelings and habits must have been those of a Norman
rather than those of a Scot. He represented neither the
old Scottish traditions which were embodied in Donald
nor yet the new foreign reformation which was embodied
in Margaret and her sons. It was no wonder then that
no party in his father’s kingdom thought of his claims
at his father’s death. <span class="sni">He receives the crown from William.</span>
But he now came to the King’s
court; he set forth the usurpation of his uncle Donald and
his own rights; he demanded the crown of his father,
and did homage for it to the Monarch of Britain.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_71" id="fnanchor_71"></a><a href="#footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span>
The
event is singularly like the earlier event which had
placed Duncan’s own father on the Scottish throne; <span class="sni">1054.</span>
it
is still more like the later event which gave Scotland a
momentary king in Edward Balliol. <span class="sni">1332.</span>
The King’s designs
on Normandy hindered him from either marching
himself to the help of Duncan or sending any part
of the regular forces of his kingdom. <span class="sni">He wins it by the help of Norman and English volunteers. 1094.</span>
But Duncan
was allowed to get together a body of volunteers,
English and French&mdash;&#8203;doubtless of any nation that he
could find&mdash;&#8203;at whose head he marched into Scotland.
He overthrew his uncle Donald, and took possession of
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
the throne by the help of his new allies.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_72" id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span>
Details are
lacking; the Scots must have been overthrown for a
moment by some sudden attack. <span class="sni">Second revolution; the foreigners driven out.</span>
What follows is instructive.
The reign of Duncan, as a king surrounded
by a Norman and English following, was but for a moment.
<span class="sni">May? 1094.</span>
But there was clearly no feeling in Scotland
against allowing him to reign, if he were willing to reign
as a national Scot. The people, startled for a moment,
took heart again. A new movement broke forth; the King
was surrounded, and the foreigners who accompanied
him were this time, not driven out, but slaughtered. He
himself escaped with a few only.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_73" id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span>
But, this work once
done, the son of Malcolm was not less willingly received
than his brother. Donald was not restored; but Duncan
was accepted as King of Scots on condition of his allowing
no English or French settlers within his realm.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_74" id="fnanchor_74"></a><a href="#footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>We may perhaps suspect that this national movement
in Scotland was timed so as to grasp the favourable
moment when the King of the English, with the mass
of his forces, was beyond the sea. This is more
clearly marked in the next revolution, which took
place towards the end of the year. While King William
was still in Normandy, while the Welsh were in
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
triumphant revolt, a powerful confederacy was formed
against Duncan. Donald now leagued himself with Malpeter,
the Mormaor of Mærne, the representative of the
old party of Macbeth, and also with Eadmund, son of
Malcolm and Margaret. This last, their only degenerate

<p><span class="sni">Events contemporary with Donald’s second reign.</span>
The three years of Donald’s second reign were contemporary
with much that we have already told, with
the whole dispute between William and Anselm, with the
preaching of the crusade, with the acquisition of Normandy.
They were contemporary with stirring events in Wales
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
which we shall speak of in another section. And they
were contemporary with events in England which, as I
have said, have a kind of connexion with the fate of
Malcolm which makes it seem on the whole most natural
to speak of them at this point. We will now therefore
go on to the chief English event of the year which
followed the second accession of Donald, namely the
revolt of Robert Earl of Northumberland.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Conspiracy against William Rufus.</span>
It is not the least strange among the strange events
of this reign that the only rebellion against William
Rufus within his kingdom, after that which immediately
followed his accession, was directly occasioned by one of
the few good deeds which are recorded of him. The King
did a simple act of justice; one of his greatest nobles at
once openly rebelled, and the open rebellion of one brought
to light the hidden conspiracy of many more. We may be
sure that there had long been a good deal of lurking
discontent which was waiting for even a slight opportunity
to break forth into a flame. The conspiracy was
devised among men of the highest rank and power, some
of them near of kindred to the King; and the open rebel
was certainly the foremost man of his own generation in
the kingdom. There were in the days of Rufus grounds
enough for discontent and revolt among any class,
and there were special grounds which specially touched
the men of highest rank. They are said to have been
offended by the King’s general harshness, and, above
all, by the strictness of his hunting-code.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_78" id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span>
The head
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
and author of the seditious movement was the stern
guardian of the northern frontier of the kingdom, Robert
of Mowbray Earl of Northumberland. He is said to
have been specially puffed up to rebellion by his
successes against Malcolm and his Scots.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_79" id="fnanchor_79"></a><a href="#footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span>
But, great
as he deemed himself, he held that he might become
greater by a powerful alliance. The gloomy Earl, with
whom speech and laughter were so rare, thought to help
his projects by taking a wife. <span class="sni">Robert of Mowbray marries Matilda of Laigle.</span>
He married Matilda of
Laigle, the daughter of that Richer who died so worthily
beneath the keep of Sainte-Susanne,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_80" id="fnanchor_80"></a><a href="#footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></span>

of slaughter among the seditious citizens of Rouen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_81" id="fnanchor_81"></a><a href="#footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></span>
Her
mother Judith was the sister of Earl Hugh of Chester;
and Robert seems to have entangled his new uncle in his
rebellious schemes. <span class="sni">His dealings with the Earl of Chester and the Bishop of Durham.</span>
One would have thought that Bishop
William of Durham had had enough of rebellion. He
was now as high in the King’s favour and counsels as
any man in the realm. He was, or at least had been,
on bad terms with his neighbour Earl Robert;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_82" id="fnanchor_82"></a><a href="#footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></span>
and it is
hard to see what can have been his temptation to join
in any seditious movement. Yet we know that there
were churchmen concerned in the conspiracy;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_83" id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span>
it is
certain that Bishop William lost the King’s favour about
this time; and there seems little doubt that he was at
least suspected of being in league with the Earl. <span class="sni">Other conspirators.</span>
Others
concerned are said to have been Philip of Montgomery, son
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
of the late Earl of Shrewsbury,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_84" id="fnanchor_84"></a><a href="#footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span>
Roger of Lacy, great in
Herefordshire and in several other shires,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_85" id="fnanchor_85"></a><a href="#footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></span>
and one nearer
to the royal house than all, <span class="sni">William of Eu.</span>
William of Eu, the late
stirrer up of strife between the King and his brother.
<span class="sni">Conspiracy in favour of Stephen of Aumale.</span>
The object of the conspiracy was said to be to put the
King to death, and to give the crown to Stephen of
Aumale, the son of Adelaide, whole sister of the
Conqueror, by her third husband, Odo Count of Champagne
and lord of Holderness.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_86" id="fnanchor_86"></a><a href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>In short, the two men who had been the first to put
castles into the King’s hands in Normandy were now
plotting against him in England. Stephen of Aumale
was to receive the English crown at the bidding of
William of Eu. <span class="sni">No general support for the plot.</span>
Such a conspiracy as this must have
been merely the device of a few discontented nobles; it
could have met with no broad ground of general support
among men of any class. No doubt many men of all
ranks and of all races would have been well pleased
to get rid of William; but there must surely have been
few who seriously hoped to set up Stephen of Aumale
as his successor. <span class="sni">No ground for Stephen’s claim.</span>
By a solemn treaty only five years old,
the reigning Duke of the Normans was marked out as
the successor to the English crown.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_87" id="fnanchor_87"></a><a href="#footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></span>
And if that
arrangement was held to be set aside by later warfare
between the brothers, there was nothing to bar the
natural claims of Henry. Neither Norman nor English
feeling could have endured that the man who was at
once Norman and English should be set aside for a
stranger from Champagne. Neither Norman nor English
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
feeling could have endured that all the sons of the
Conqueror should be set aside in favour of the son of
his sister. Truly men of any rank or any race had
good reason to revolt against William Rufus. But this
was like the revolt of the Earls in the days of the elder
William,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_88" id="fnanchor_88"></a><a href="#footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></span>
a purely personal and selfish revolt, which
called forth no sympathy, Norman or English. Still
a large party was ready to revolt on any occasion. And
the occasion was presently found.</p>

<p>It was found, as far as Earl Robert was concerned,
in a wanton breach of common right and of the law
of nations, which it was assumed that the King would
treat as an act of defiance against his authority.
Four Norwegian trading ships had peacefully anchored
in some Northumbrian haven. <span class="sni">Earl Robert plunders the Norwegian ships.</span>
Earl Robert, his
nephew Morel, and their followers, wantonly plundered
the ships, and took away their whole cargoes. And
the tale is told as if the act of plunder was meant
directly as an act of rebellion against the King, whose
peace was certainly broken in the most outrageous way.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_89" id="fnanchor_89"></a><a href="#footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></span>

<span class="sni">The merchants complain to the King.</span>

against the Earl of the Northumbrians.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_90" id="fnanchor_90"></a><a href="#footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></span>
Had such
an act been done by any of William’s own following, the
injured men would most likely have met with no redress.
But plunder done by anybody else on his own account
was an outrage on the royal authority&mdash;&#8203;one might perhaps
say an encroachment on the royal monopoly of
oppression&mdash;&#8203;with which the Red King was not minded
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
to put up. William straightway sent the strictest and
sternest orders to Earl Robert to restore at once all that
had been taken from the Norwegian merchants. <span class="sni">Robert refuses redress.</span>
The
Earl scornfully took no notice. The King then asked
the amount of the merchants’ losses, and made it good
to them from his own hoard. <span class="sni">He is summoned to the King’s court.</span>

<p>Such is the story which reached the cloister of Saint
Evroul, a story altogether likely in itself, and which
well fits in with and explains the entries in our own
Chronicle. These bring us into the thick of the regular
assemblies of this year of assemblies. The gathering
at Rockingham dealt wholly with the affairs of Anselm;
<span class="sni">Gemót of Winchester. March 25, 1095.</span>
to the regular Easter assembly at Winchester which
so soon followed it, Earl Robert, though specially summoned,
refused to come. The King was very wroth
against him, and sent word that, if he did not wish to
be altogether put out of the King’s peace, he must come
to the court to be held at Pentecost.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_92" id="fnanchor_92"></a><a href="#footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></span>
Signs in the
heavens seem to have foretold that something was
coming. <span class="sni">The falling stars. April 4.</span>
It was now, on the night of the feast of Easter
and again ten days later, that a crowd of stars was
seen to fall from heaven, not one or two, but so thickly
that no man could tell them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_93" id="fnanchor_93"></a><a href="#footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span>
If the stars fought against
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">42</span>
Malcolm on the day of Saint Brice, it was only in their
courses, and no chronicler has recorded the fact. But
it looks as if this special Easter shower, of which we
have elsewhere heard other meanings,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_94" id="fnanchor_94"></a><a href="#footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span>
was by some
at least held to portend the fall of the great earl of the
North. <span class="sni">Messages between the King and Robert.</span>
The time between Easter and Pentecost, the
time so busily occupied in another range of subjects
by the coming of Cardinal Walter and the acknowledgement
of Pope Urban,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_95" id="fnanchor_95"></a><a href="#footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span>
was no less busily occupied by
an exchange of messages between the King and his
undutiful subject. Robert, like Godwine two-and-forty
years before, demanded hostages and a safe-conduct,
before he would risk himself before the Assembly.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_96" id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span>
This
the King refused; Robert, arraigned on a definite charge
of open robbery, had no such claim to hostages as
Godwine, as King Malcolm, or even as his own neighbour
Bishop William. <span class="sni">Whitsun Gemót. Windsor, May 13, 1095.</span>
The Whitsun-feast was held; the King
was at Windsor&mdash;&#8203;not at Westminster&mdash;&#8203;and all his Witan
with him. Anselm was there, to be received into the
King’s favour, and to engage to observe the customs of
the realm.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_97" id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></span>
But the Earl of the Northumbrians was
not there.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_98" id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span>
The two accounts fit in perfectly without
contradiction or difficulty. One gives us the cause of
the special summons of Earl Robert to the Gemót; the
other gives us its exact date and form.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The King’s march.</span>
Rufus, thus defied, at once took to arms. It would
seem that he did not wholly rely on his mercenaries,
but called out the national force of the kingdom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_99" id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span>
He
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
was again the King of the English, marching at the head
of his people. He was marching against the rebel fortresses
of the North, as he had once marched against
Tunbridge, Pevensey, and Rochester. <span class="sni">His motives.</span>
But these great
preparations were not made simply to avenge the wrongs
of the Norwegian merchants. Their wrongs were the
outward occasion, and that was all. The refusal of Earl
Robert to come to the King’s court was the counterpart
of the more general refusal of the Norman nobles to come
to the Easter Assembly seven years earlier.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_100" id="fnanchor_100"></a><a href="#footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span>
The
King knew, or had good reason to suspect, that there
was again a wide-spread conspiracy afloat to deprive
him of his crown and life. Of this conspiracy the open
disobedience of Earl Robert was simply the first outward
sign; the affair of the Norwegian merchants had merely
brought matters to a head. Rufus may even have
made use of their wrongs as a pretext for proving
Robert’s doubtful loyalty. Robert was as yet the only
open rebel. When the King drew the sword, he met
with no resistance anywhere save where the Earl of
the Northumbrians was in possession. Robert’s accomplices
remained accomplices and conspirators; they did
not dare to risk the chances of open rebellion. The
Earl may have thought that the strength which had
twice overcome a King of Scots might defy a King of
the English also.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_101" id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Robert resists.</span>
At all events, Robert of Mowbray
withstood the King in arms, and a stirring and varied
campaign followed.</p>

<p>It appears however from an incidental notice that
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
Earl Robert and his fellows by no means trusted only
to movements within the realm. <span class="sni">Help expected from Normandy.</span>
It is certainly strange
that a conspiracy in which William of Eu could be even
suspected of taking a part should have found any support
in Normandy; yet in those times men changed sides
so easily that it is not impossible that he might have
been again intriguing with Duke Robert himself. It
is still more likely that some intrigue was going on,
not with the Norman Duke but with the enemies of
Rufus in Normandy as well as in England. It is
certain that an invasion of south-eastern England was
at this time daily dreaded;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_102" id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span>
and it is perhaps more likely
that William of Eu, Stephen of Aumale, and the rest,
were planning an expedition at their own risk than that
Duke Robert was designing anything with the regular
forces of Normandy. The invasion was plainly looked
on as a serious danger; but there is no reason to think
that it ever took place. The King thought it needful
to take special means for guarding the coast. <span class="sni">The King marches to Nottingham.</span>
He had
gone on his northern march as far as Nottingham,
accompanied not only, as we might expect, by many
of his nobles, but what we might less have looked for,
by both the archbishops and by the Cardinal Bishop of
Albano.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_103" id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Anselm’s command in Kent.</span>
One might almost think that some special
news was brought to the King at this point; for it was
now that Anselm, in this his short season of renewed
favour with the King, was sent back to guard his city
and diocese. He received the trust from the King’s
own mouth; he went back to Canterbury, whither a
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
writ from the King followed him bidding him stay
in care of the city, ready at any moment, when news
should be brought from the threatened havens, at once
to gather together horse and foot for the defence of the
land.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_104" id="fnanchor_104"></a><a href="#footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span>
Anselm went back to his metropolis, and there
stayed, as we have seen, ready to discharge these unusual
duties, which, as the expected invasion never came, did
not in the end involve any military action on his part.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King went on, taking with him the
Archbishop of York, who at Nottingham was already
in his own province and diocese. <span class="sni">The King draws near to Northumberland.</span>
When the march
had gone on somewhat further, when the King and
his host were drawing near to the borders of the
Northumbrian earldom, that is, we may suppose, when
they were near the banks of the Tyne, an incident
happened which showed that the enemies of Rufus had
other schemes besides those of open warfare either at
home or abroad.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_105" id="fnanchor_105"></a><a href="#footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span>

and who seems now to be looked on as a traitor in the

falls at his feet and craves his pardon for his offences.

<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
Rufus wonders and hesitates, but, after a little debate
in his own mind, he promises the pardon that is asked
for. Gilbert then warns the King not to enter a certain
wood&mdash;&#8203;have we again the tale of the hunting-party
as the scene of assassination?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_108" id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span>
He was himself one of
a body who had plotted the King’s death, and a party

but the
story reads as if no immediate action was taken against
them. The conspirators are baulked of their prey, and
the King’s host marches on to attack the fortresses of
the rebel Earl.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_110" id="fnanchor_110"></a><a href="#footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Defence of Robert’s fortresses.</span>
Robert of Mowbray had made good preparations for defence.
The main body of his followers, among them the
men highest in rank and most trusted in valour, guarded
the great frontier fortress of his earldom, <span class="sni">The New Castle.</span>
the New Castle
which Duke Robert had reared to guard the way to the

it rose above the Tyne with far more of the usual position
of a fortress than would be dreamed by one who merely
passes so strangely near to it on the modern railway,
or who lights almost by chance on gateway and castle
imbedded in the streets of the modern town. The
gateway, even the keep as it now stands, are both of
later date than the time of our story. But the days
of Monkchester were passed; the New Castle was
already a place of arms, a strong post standing right
in the way of the King’s advance against the rebellious
land. Lower down the tidal stream, beyond the relics&mdash;&#8203;they
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
were then still something more than relics&mdash;&#8203;of the

at Wallcar, and at Wallsend<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_113" id="fnanchor_113"></a><a href="#footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;fast by the mouth of the
estuary whose shores and whose waters are now so
thickly set with the works of modern industry&mdash;&#8203;the
<span class="sni">Tynemouth.</span>
Earl’s castle of Tynemouth at once sheltered the rising
monastery of Saint Oswine and guarded the approach
to the river and to all to which the river led. Tynemouth
was held by the Earl’s brother; <span class="sni">Bamburgh.</span>
Robert himself,
far to the north, kept the great stronghold of all, the
old seat of Northumbrian power, which frowns over
land and sea from the basaltic rock of Bamburgh. The
King’s first attack was lucky; we have no details; but
we read that the New Castle was taken, and that all
the men that were in it were kept in ward. <span class="sni">Taking of the New Castle.</span>
The
choicest men of Earl Robert’s following were thus in
the King’s hands; the inland centre of his power was
lost; but he and his brother still held out in their
fastnesses by the Ocean.</p>

<p>Tynemouth and Bamburgh both stood long sieges.
The strong site of the monastic stronghold enabled it
to bear up for two months, while the fortress of Ida
remained, as far as any strictly military operation was
concerned, untaken during the whole war. <span class="sni">Siege of Tynemouth.</span>
Tynemouth,
which had so lately seen the burial of Malcolm, had
now to endure the assaults of the royal force in the
cause of Malcolm’s chief enemy. The holy place of
Saint Oswine was strong alike by nature and art. <span class="sni">Description of the site.</span>
At
the mouth of the great Northumbrian river, on that
bank of it which lay within Robert’s earldom, two
headlands, divided by a small bay, stand forth boldly
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>
to meet the waves of the German Ocean. In later times
the fortified precinct took in both points. Both came
within the wall and ditch which cut off the peninsulas
from the mainland. The castle of Tynemouth, strictly
so called, covered the southern height immediately above
the river. The northern promontory was crowned by
the church and the monastic buildings, themselves
sheltered by a vast gatehouse, which itself grew into
a castle. Such, there is reason to believe, was the
arrangement in the days of Malcolm and William. The
castle of Robert of Mowbray rose sheer above the estuary,
on its left bank. To the north, on the other headland,
protected by a smaller fortress, stood the church and
monastery which were growing up at his bidding, a
tribute paid by the conquerors to the ancient worthies
of the land. <span class="sni">The monastic peninsula.</span>
The peninsula crowned by the monastic
stronghold stretches forth into the waters, like a miniature
of that which is at once the oldest and the newest
Syracuse, since the art of man joined the island of
Ortygia to the mainland of Sicily. While the neck
is strengthened by works of defence, the rocky headland
rises boldly from the waves on two sides. To the south
the ground rises more gently above the bay between the
two peninsulas, the bay to which the monastery above it
gave the name of the Prior’s haven. The town which
grew up in after times sprang up directly to the west
of the approach to the northern headland; it now spreads
itself on all sides save only on the two headlands themselves.
<span class="sni">Taking of Tynemouth. July? 1095.</span>
The first attack must have been made from
the older site of the town; the small fortress, that most
likely which guarded the neck of the monastic headland,
was taken. The main castle to the south fell at the
end of two months, and the Earl’s brother and the
knights who defended it shared the fate of the defenders
of the New Castle.</p>

<p><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pageno">49</span>
And now came the hardest struggle of all, the

<span class="title">Bebbanburh</span>,
Bamburgh&mdash;&#8203;the royal city of Bernicia, which
its founder had fenced first with a hedge and then
with a wall or earthwork&mdash;&#8203;the city small but strong,
with its steep height approached only by steps<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_114" id="fnanchor_114"></a><a href="#footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;though
its main purpose was military and not religious,
contained within its walls a sanctuary and a relic as
worshipful as aught that was sheltered by Tynemouth
or Jarrow or Durham itself. <span class="sni">The relic of Saint Oswald.</span>
The ancient church of
Bamburgh was honoured by the presence of the wonder-working
hand of the martyred Bretwalda Oswald. That
relic had in earlier days helped, along with the prayers
of Aidan, to save Bamburgh from the fires of Penda;
we are not told whether it was by the favour of the
martyr that the elder Waltheof sheltered himself within
the impregnable walls, while his valiant son marched
forth to victory. The city, the small city which took
in the space only of a few fields, had doubtless by this
time given way to the Norman fortress, strengthened
by all the arts which the Norman had brought with
him. The castle precincts, in their widest extent, clearly
cover the whole of the ancient site; <a name="southwest" id="southwest"></a>at the south-western
end they are still approached by steps which doubtless
represent those which in the days of the old Northumbrian
chronicler were the only means of mounting
the height. At Bamburgh, as elsewhere, we are met by
the never-failing difficulty which besets the student of the
castles of that age. Can any of the work at Bamburgh
which bears the impress of Norman art be safely assigned
to the eleventh century? <span class="sni">The keep.</span>
Or must we give up all to the
twelfth, and believe that no part of the great centre of
the building, the keep “huge and square,” was already in
being when Robert of Mowbray defied the Red King from
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
his rock? On such a point it is dangerous to be over-positive.
The surrounding walls are of all dates down to
the basest modern imitations; the chapel which guarded
the relic of Saint Oswald, standing apart in the great
court with its eastern apse overlooking the sea, was
clearly, when perfect, no mean work of the next age.
But whatever was the character or the material of the
defences of Robert’s day, they were doubtless as strong as
any skill within the Northumbrian earldom could make
them. There, from the castle raised on the land side
on the bulwarks of the rock out of which its walls
and bastions grow, rising on the sea side over deep
and shifting hills of sand, the eye might take in the
long indented coast, the sea dotted with islands of
which many play a part in the sacred story of
northern England,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_115" id="fnanchor_115"></a><a href="#footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;Farn and its fellows hard by, hallowed
by the abode and death of Saint Cuthberht&mdash;&#8203;Holy
Island itself further to the north-west, the landscape
bounded in the far distance by the border hills
of the two British kingdoms, beyond which Malcolm
no longer stood ready to ravage the pastures of Northumberland.
<span class="sni">Robert defends Bamburgh against the King.</span>
Within that ancient fortress, rich with
so many earlier associations, the proud and gloomy Earl
now kept his ground, adding a new and stirring page
to the long history of Bamburgh. His brother and his
best knights were the King’s prisoners; but, strong on
his rocky height, the Earl of the Northumbrians, heedless
of the lesson of seven years earlier, dared to bid defiance
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">51</span>
to the King of the English and to the whole strength
of his kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Strength of the position.</span>
And in truth the event proved that the rebellious
daring of Robert of Mowbray had better grounds than
the daring of those who had held Rochester and Pevensey,
Tynemouth and the New Castle, against their sovereign.
The well of the purest water, hollowed out on the highest
point of the rock, and then, or at some later day, taken
in within the massive walls of the huge keep, made
Robert safe from all such dangers as threatened the
Ætheling Henry when he held out on the rock of
Saint Michael.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_116" id="fnanchor_116"></a><a href="#footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Direct attacks fail.</span>
All the power and skill of the Red
King was brought to bear upon the ancient stronghold;
but all was in vain; the castle of Bebbe was not to
be taken by any open attack. William therefore took
to slower means of warfare. <span class="sni">Making of the <span class="title">Malvoisin</span>.</span>
He made one of those
towers which were so often made in such cases, to act
as a check on the besieged castle, to form in fact an
imperfect kind of blockade. This tower must have
stood on the land side, to cut off all hope of help from
any friendly quarter. It therefore could not have stood
very far from the site of the present village; and in
the fields nearly south of the castle some faint traces of
earthworks seem not unlikely to mark the site of the
tower to which the King gave the significant name of
<span class="title">Malvoisin</span>. <span class="sni">Its effects.</span>
The new work is described as exercising
all the energies of the royal army, and as striking such
fear into the hearts of the besieged that many of
Robert’s party now forsook him and entered the King’s
service. <span class="sni">Alleged despair of Robert.</span>
We are even told that the fierce Earl looked
out from the height of Bamburgh in all fear and sadness,
crying out to his accomplices by name to be mindful
of the traitorous oaths which they had sworn to him.
The King and his friends were merry as they heard,
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
and none of those who were appealed to, tormented
as they were with fear and shame, went back to share
the Earl’s waning fortunes. Be this as it may, as far
as open force went, Bamburgh and its lord remained
unsubdued. <span class="sni">The castle still not taken.</span>
To bring either of them under his power,
the King and his followers were fain to have recourse
to false promises and cruel threats.</p>

<p>The Evil Neighbour of Bamburgh was built; it was
well stocked with guards, arms, and victuals. But Bamburgh
itself was not taken any the more. William did
not in this case, as he did in some of his continental
enterprises, throw up the whole undertaking, because he
did not succeed in the first or second attack. So to have
done would have been pretty much the same as throwing
up his crown; it would have been to unteach the great
lesson of his reign, and to declare that the Earl of the
Northumbrians was stronger than the King of the English.
He might turn away in wilfulness from this or that
Norman or Cenomannian fortress which he had attacked
in wilfulness; but he knew the art of reigning better
than to leave Bamburgh in the possession of a rebel earl.
<span class="sni">The King goes away.</span>
The work was to go on; but he was so far tired of it that
he left it to be done by others. When the <span class="title">Malvoisin</span> was
well strengthened, the King turned away, and appeared no
more before Bamburgh during the rest of the campaign.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Michaelmas, 1095.</span>
When Rufus left Bamburgh, he went southward;
he then went to the war in Wales, and left the garrison
of the <span class="title">Malvoisin</span> to keep watch over their besieged
neighbour. It may be left to casuists in chivalry to
judge whether the knightly king approved of the means
which were now taken in order to entrap the besieged
earl. <span class="sni">Robert entrapped by a false message.</span>
The garrison of the New Castle, doubtless not
without the knowledge of the garrison of the <span class="title">Malvoisin</span>,
sent a false message to Robert, saying that, if he came
thither privily, he would be received into the castle.
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
The Earl, naturally well pleased at such a prospect of
winning back his lost stronghold, set forth by night for
the New Castle at the head of thirty knights. The men
from the <span class="title">Malvoisin</span> watched and followed him, and sent
to the men of the New Castle to say that he was on the
way. Knowing nothing of what was going on, Earl
Robert drew near to the New Castle on a Sunday, expecting,
it would seem, to be received there with welcome.
His hopes were vain; he was taken, and the more part
of his followers also were taken, killed, or wounded. <span class="sni">He flees to Tynemouth.</span>
The
version which goes most into detail says that, when he
saw that he was betrayed by the garrison of the New
Castle, he fled, with a part at least of his following, to
his own monastery at Tynemouth. It is not easy
to see how this could be, unless he was able either
to win back the small fortress on the neck of the
monastic peninsula, or else to climb up from the seaside
at some less steep or less strongly defended point
of the height. But the tale is so told that there must be
at least some kernel of truth in it. <span class="sni">He is besieged in the monastery,</span>
We read that the
Earl stood something like a siege in his own monastery.
He was able, with his small party, to defend himself in
it for six days, and to kill and wound many of his
assailants. At last, on the sixth day, he himself received
a severe wound in the leg; the whole of his followers
were taken, some of them also as wounded men. The
Earl, himself among the latter, contrived to drag himself
to the church of his own rearing, where still lay the body
of the Scottish King whom some looked on as his victim.
If claims of sanctuary were thought of, they were not
allowed, and one who had turned the consecrated precinct
into a castle had perhaps little claim to plead such privileges,
even within his own foundation. <span class="sni">taken, and imprisoned.</span>
Earl Robert was
dragged away from his own church, and was kept in
prison to await the King’s pleasure.</p>

<p><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
<span class="sni">Bamburgh defended by Matilda of Laigle.</span>
A tale of twenty years back now repeats itself in our
story. A strong castle is again defended by a valiant
bride. As Norwich, after the revolt and flight of Ralph
of Wader, was defended by Emma of Breteuil, so Bamburgh,
after the revolt and capture of Robert of Mowbray,
was defended by Matilda of Laigle. Married just as the
revolt broke out, she had had, we are told, but little
taste of joyful or peaceful wedlock; but she was at least
zealous in the cause of her husband. She had Morel to
her counsellor and captain, and the two held out in the
ancient stronghold against all attacks. <span class="sni">November, 1095.</span>
It was now
winter, and King William had come back from Snowdon,
not covered with much glory. He felt no mind to renew
the siege of Bamburgh in his own person; but he bade
that the captive Earl should be taken thither, and led
before the walls, with the threat to his wife and nephew
that, if the castle was not at once given up, the eyes of
its lord should be then and there seared out in their
sight. <span class="sni">She yields to save her husband’s eyes.</span>
To this threat Matilda and Morel yielded, and
the gates of the unconquered fortress were thrown open
to the King’s forces. The valiant Countess thus saved
her husband’s eyes; but his eyes were all that she could
save. Robert was sent back to prison at Windsor, to live
in bonds, at least for a season, and in no case to return
to the rights and duties of an earl or a husband. <span class="sni">Later history of Robert; two versions.</span>
But
there are two widely different stories as to his later fate.
The local history of Saint Alban’s told how one who,
however guilty towards others, was at least a benefactor
to that house, was allowed to spend his remaining days
as a monk within its walls. At Saint Evroul a widely
different tale was believed. It was there recorded by the
contemporary writer that Robert survived his capture
thirty years, but that the whole of that time was passed
in hopeless imprisonment. If so, he must have been
looked on as dangerous by the calm prudence of Henry
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>
no less than by the wrath or the revenge of Rufus. The
story indeed runs that his imprisonment was deemed so
irrevocable that it was held to amount to a civil death.
The once proud Earl of Northumberland was counted
to have passed away from among men as much as if the
grave had closed over him alongside of Malcolm in his
own Tynemouth. <span class="sni">Later history of Matilda; her second marriage and divorce.</span>
By a special permission from Pope
Paschal, Matilda was allowed to marry again, as though
she had been his widow and not his wife. Nigel of
Albini became her second husband; but, after the death
of her brother Gilbert of Laigle, he thought he could
better himself by marriage in another quarter. His
marriage with Matilda was declared void, not on the
ground that Robert was alive, but because of some
kindred, real or alleged, between Robert and Nigel. The
papal dispensation must have been badly drawn, if it did
not provide for the lesser irregularity as well as for the
greater. Of Matilda we hear no more; Nigel took him
another wife of the house of Gournay. Gerard had by
that time died on his way to the crusade;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_117" id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span>
his widow
Eadgyth had married again, and their son Hugh was lord
of Gournay. Their daughter, who inherited the name of
Gundrada from her mother’s mother, took the place of the
forsaken Matilda, who was thus left in a strange plight,
as the widow, so to speak, of two living husbands.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Morel turns King’s evidence.</span>
Meanwhile her partner in the defence of Bamburgh,
Morel, the nephew and steward of the fallen Earl, made
his peace with the King by naming all who had any share
in the late conspiracy. Not a few men of high rank,
clerical and lay, were accused by him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_118" id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span>
The time of the
Midwinter Gemót drew nigh, at which the offenders would
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
regularly be brought for trial. The King’s prisons were
full,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_119" id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span>
and he determined that the gaol delivery should be a
striking and a solemn one. <span class="sni">Christmas Gemót of 1095&ndash;1096.</span>
The Assembly of that Christmas-tide
was to be a <span class="title">Mickle Gemót</span> indeed, a Gemót like
those which had gathered in King Eadward’s day beneath
the walls of London and in King William’s day upon the
plain of Salisbury. A summons of special urgency went
forth, bidding all men who held any land of the King, if
they wished to be deemed worthy of the King’s peace, to
come to his court at the appointed time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_120" id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span>
The call was
answered. The appointed place of meeting was Windsor,
and there the Assembly came together. But the business
to be done needed a longer time than the usual twelve days
of Christmas, and the gathering was greater than the royal
castle and its courts could hold. <span class="sni">Adjourned from Windsor to Salisbury. January 13, 1096.</span>
The work began at
Windsor; but an adjournment was needed, and on the
octave of the Epiphany in the opening year we find the
King and his Witan at Salisbury.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_121" id="fnanchor_121"></a><a href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span>
The wide fields which
had seen the great review and the great homage in the
days of the elder William could alone hold the crowd
which came together to share in the great court of doom
which was now holden by the younger.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Constitutional importance of the meeting.</span>
The Gemót of this winter, and specially the strict
general summons sent forth by the King, are of high
constitutional importance. They show how, even under
such a king as Rufus, the old constitutional forms went
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
on. They show how great is the error of those who dream
that the Norman kingship in England was as thorough a
despotism in form as it undoubtedly was in substance.
<span class="sni">Continuance of the old forms.</span>
In the eleventh century, as in the sixteenth, the whole
future of English history turned on the fact that constitutional
forms still went on, that assemblies were still
brought together, even if they came together for little
more than to register the edicts of the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_122" id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span>
So now
Rufus himself, when about to make a great display of
kingly power, specially summons no small part of the
nation to take a share in his acts. <span class="sni">Import of the summons.</span>
On the one hand,
the need of the summons shows that, unless at some
specially exciting moment, men did not flock eagerly to
such gatherings.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_123" id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span>
On the other hand, the fact of the
summons shows that kings then knew, that Rufus himself
knew, that the gathering of such an assembly was
both a sign and a source, not of weakness but of strength,
on the part of the kingly power.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_124" id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span>
But in the form of
the summons we may see that the assembly, though still
large, is gradually narrowing. <span class="sni">Tenants-in-chief only summoned.</span>
The summons goes, not
to all freemen, not to all land-owners, but only to the
King’s tenants-in-chief. <span class="sni">Their great number.</span>
These, it must be remembered,
were a very large body, including land-owners on every
scale, from the greatest to the smallest. And it must
be further remembered that in this body a vast majority
of the influential members were strangers by
birth, but that a great numerical proportion, most
likely a numerical majority, were natives. The King’s
thegn, who had kept a scrap of his old estate, was
as much a member of the court as Earl Hugh of
Shrewsbury or Earl Walter of Buckingham, though he
was not so likely to be listened to in any debate that
might arise as Earl Hugh or Earl Walter was. Still
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
the special summons to the King’s tenants-in-chief marks
a change; it marks the growth of the new ideas. The
immediate reason was doubtless to be found in the
main object for which the Assembly came together.
The main work of the earlier Gemót of Salisbury was
that all men in the realm, of whatever lord they held,
should become the men of the King. <span class="sni">Comparison with the Conqueror’s Gemót at Salisbury.</span>
William the Great
therefore summoned the men of other lords, who had
not up to that moment been his own men, who owed
obedience to him as head of the kingdom, but who
was not bound to him by any more personal tie. He
summoned them in order that they might bind themselves
to him by that personal tie, that they might become
his men as well as his subjects. But the main work of
the present Gemót was to sit in judgement on a crowd of
offenders, of various ranks and orders, but all of whom
were likely to be tenants-in-chief of the King. According
to the notions which were coming in, the right court
for their trial was the court of their peers, their fellow
tenants-in-chief. The King, who could summon whom he
would, who sometimes summoned few and sometimes many,
this time, for this special purpose, summoned the whole
body of his tenants-in-chief, great and small, and summoned
no others. <span class="sni">Effects of the practice of summons.</span>
But, as every summons tends practically
to the exclusion of those who are not summoned, this
summons of a particular class marks a stage in the process
by which the Assembly shrank up from the crowd
which decreed the restoration of Godwine to a House of
Lords of the reign of Henry the Eighth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_125" id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span>
Still the actual
gathering, even of the summoned members only, must
have been very great. <span class="sni">Action of the Assembly.</span>
When it came together, the
Assembly must have followed the same law as all other
assemblies of that age. Practically it decreed as the
King willed; only a few of the great men were likely to
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
say anything to guide the King’s will; the mass of the
assembly were not likely to do more than to make the
King’s acts their own by crying Yea, Yea. We must
however remember that they had not the slightest temptation
to cry Nay, Nay. <span class="sni">No general sympathy with the accused.</span>
The mass of the inhabitants
of the land, Norman and English alike, were not likely
to have the faintest sympathy with any one who really
had a share in the late treason. The only question was
whether any were accused who had no share in it. In
the case of those who were charged only with conspiracy
and not with open revolt, this might easily be.
Otherwise the Red King, in the vengeance which he
now took, did no more than justice, as justice was deemed
in his day. But his justice was far sharper than the
justice of the old kings, far sharper than the justice
of his father. And the tone in which the story is told
implies that men at the time felt that it was so.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Sickness of the Bishop of Durham.</span>
One of the great men of the realm, who, whether
guilty or not, seems to have been at least suspected, died,
while the Assembly was in session, before any formal
charge had been brought against him. Before the Bishop
of Durham came to Windsor, it was known in his own
diocese that he had not long to live. <span class="sni">Portents foretelling his death.</span>
One of his knights,
Boso by name, had, while lying under a dangerous
sickness, been favoured with trances and visions, which
told him much that was comforting about the monks
of Durham, and much that was fearful about other
folk. He saw the old inhabitants of the land, he
saw the new French settlers, above all, he saw the
priests’ wives&mdash;&#8203;these seem to be looked on as three
classes of offenders, gradually increasing in blackness&mdash;&#8203;suffering
each a grievous doom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_126" id="fnanchor_126"></a><a href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span>
His visions about the
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
Bishop himself might perhaps point to an intermediate
destiny; at all events they were understood as implying
his speedy death.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_127" id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">His work at Durham. 1083. 1093.</span>
His work perhaps was done. Thirteen
years before he had filled the church of Durham
with monks;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_128" id="fnanchor_128"></a><a href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span>
three years before he had begun the great
work of its rebuilding; and, by pressing it on with almost
incredible speed, he had carried it on so far as to set
an example of unsurpassed grandeur in its own style, an
example which his own monks could not follow, but
which Randolf Flambard could.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_129" id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">He is summoned to take his trial.</span>
William of Saint-Calais
came to the Gemót, and was summoned by the
King to appear to take his trial.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_130" id="fnanchor_130"></a><a href="#footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span>
He pleaded sickness
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
as his excuse for not appearing. Rufus declared, with
his usual oath, that the excuse was a feigned one.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_131" id="fnanchor_131"></a><a href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">He sickens and dies. December 25, 1095-January 1, 1096.</span>
It
was however thoroughly real. Bishop William was sick,

Nativity, and died on the day of the Circumcision.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_132" id="fnanchor_132"></a><a href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">His death-bed.</span>
He
was comforted in his sickness by the presence and exhortations
of several of his brother bishops who had
come together for the business of the Assembly. There
was Anselm whom he had withstood at Rockingham;
there was his own metropolitan Thomas; there was
Walkelin of Winchester; there was John of Bath, born,
like himself and Anselm, beyond the bounds either of
England or of Normandy. <span class="sni">Debate as to his burying-place.</span>
These prelates debated concerning
the place of his burial. They argued that he
who had done such great things for Saint Cuthberht’s
abbey should be buried in the place of highest honour
within its walls. He himself declined any such place.
He would be no party to any breach of Saint Cuthberht’s
own rule, which forbade that any man should be
buried within his minster.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_133" id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span>
The bishops therefore ruled
that he should be buried in the chapter-house, so that
his monks, when they came together, should have the
tomb of their founder ever before their eyes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_134" id="fnanchor_134"></a><a href="#footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span>
So it was;
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">62</span>
<span class="sni">He is buried in the chapter-house.</span>
he was borne to Durham, and there laid in the place
which the bishops had chosen for him, among the tears

any one of whom, we are told, would gladly have died
for him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_135" id="fnanchor_135"></a><a href="#footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span></p>

those whom it did smite, it was certainly somewhat
capricious, or at least guided by expediency, with regard
to those whom it smote and those whom it failed to
smite. Some of the offenders were men of the highest
rank, some even, it is implied, of the rank of Earl. But
these powerful rebels, ashamed and weakened by the fall
of their brother of Northumberland, were now deemed
fitting objects of mercy. By the advice of the Wise
Men, they were spared a public trial;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_136" id="fnanchor_136"></a><a href="#footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></span>
but some of them

At the

bearing a name famous in London city, appealed no less

of conspiring to slay him, and to give his crown to

 <span class="sni">Combat of Geoffrey of Baynard and William of Eu.</span>
The charge was denied, and,
as both parties were Frenchmen, the trial was, by the

The judicial combat which followed is memorable in the
history of the time, and forms one of the landmarks in
our early jurisprudence.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Defeat of William of Eu.</span>
On the plain of Salisbury the combatants met, and
William of Eu was overthrown.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_140" id="fnanchor_140"></a><a href="#footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></span>
By the laws of the
combat his defeat was full evidence of his guilt. But
what was to be his punishment? Save the case of the
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
beheading of Waltheof, there was no precedent in the
ordinary jurisprudence either of England or of Normandy
for any sentence harsher than banishment, forfeiture, and
imprisonment.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_141" id="fnanchor_141"></a><a href="#footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></span>
The older English precedents went for
banishment and forfeiture. The precedents of Normandy
and of Norman rule in England went for
imprisonment, such an imprisonment, it might be, as
that of Robert of Mowbray. For the course actually
taken there was no precedent in either land, unless it
were the dealings of Harold the son of Cnut with the
Ætheling Ælfred.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_142" id="fnanchor_142"></a><a href="#footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Sentence of mutilation on William of Eu.</span>
The punishment decreed was that
of bodily mutilation. <span class="sni">Urged by Hugh of Chester.</span>
It is said that this course was
proposed by Earl Hugh of Chester, and that on a singular
ground. William of Eu was the husband of the
Earl’s sister&mdash;&#8203;her name is not mentioned. He had
neglected his wife, while he had three children by a
mistress.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_143" id="fnanchor_143"></a><a href="#footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></span>
If this was to be ground for the loss of eyes
or limbs, the brothers of the Countess Ermentrude would
have had a right to demand that the portly person of
Earl Hugh should be cut down to a shapeless trunk.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_144" id="fnanchor_144"></a><a href="#footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span>

<span class="sni">Feeling with regard to mutilation.</span>
Mutilation, it should be remembered, was a familiar
punishment, a punishment which in that generation
aroused no horror when the persons so dealt with were
held to be real criminals.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_145" id="fnanchor_145"></a><a href="#footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span>
But, with that common inconsistency
which reverses the sound rule of smiting the
leaders and sparing the commons, mutilation, death, or
any heavy punishment, seems always to have aroused
horror, or at least amazement, when it was inflicted on
any criminal of lofty rank. Such things had been done
in the isle of Britain and out of it, but hardly by the
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>
solemn sentence of the King of the English at the head
of his Witan. But now William of Eu was blinded, and
underwent a fouler mutilation as well.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_146" id="fnanchor_146"></a><a href="#footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></span>
His sentence
was seemingly carried out at Salisbury, perhaps in sight
of the assembly. Are we to infer that any show of indignation
was called forth by the bloody sight, when we
read directly afterwards that some of the lord of Eu’s
fellow-sufferers were taken to London, and were blinded
or otherwise mutilated there?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_147" id="fnanchor_147"></a><a href="#footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Story of Arnulf of Hesdin.</span>
If we may trust a tale to be found in one of those
secondary writers who often preserve scraps of truth,
another accused man appealed to the wager of battle
with better luck than William of Eu. This was Arnulf
of Hesdin, a man whose name is familiar enough to us
in Domesday, though it does not call up any distinct
personal idea like the King’s unlucky kinsman.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_148" id="fnanchor_148"></a><a href="#footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span>
He
is set before us as a man of great bodily stature,
brave and active, and in the enjoyment of large possessions,
out of which he and his wife Emmeline had made
gifts to the abbey of Gloucester.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_149" id="fnanchor_149"></a><a href="#footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></span>
He was charged, unjustly
and enviously we are told, with the same crime as
the rest.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_150" id="fnanchor_150"></a><a href="#footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">His innocence proved by battle.</span>
He defended himself by his champion, who
proved his lord’s innocence by overthrowing a man of
the King’s who was matched against him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_151" id="fnanchor_151"></a><a href="#footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span>
But Arnulf
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>
was so stirred up with wrath and grief at the unjust
charge, that, notwithstanding the King’s entreaties to
stay, he threw up all the lands that he held of him, and
left England for ever.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_152" id="fnanchor_152"></a><a href="#footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">He goes to the Crusade,</span>
Before the end of the year, the
Crusade offered him worthy occupation elsewhere. He
marched with the Christian host as far as Antioch; he
there fell sick, and declined all medical help; none should
heal him save Him for whose sake he had gone on pilgrimage.
<span class="sni">and dies.</span>
Arnulf, professing the opposite doctrine to Asa
of Judah, fared no better than that king. Antioch was
the last stage reached by the armed pilgrim of Hesdin.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_153" id="fnanchor_153"></a><a href="#footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Confiscation of lands.</span>
Arnulf, according to this story, became landless, as far
as England was concerned, by his own act. Others
underwent the same loss by sentence, it seems, of the
Assembly. Count Odo of Champagne and many others
lost their lands.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_154" id="fnanchor_154"></a><a href="#footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></span>
In one case only does death seem to
have been inflicted. <span class="sni">William of Alderi is condemned to death.</span>
William of Alderi, cousin and
steward of William of Eu, was, as the Chronicle tells us,
“hanged on rood.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_155" id="fnanchor_155"></a><a href="#footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></span>
This somewhat startling formula
doubtless means nothing but ordinary hanging; but it
seemingly marks hanging of any kind as something
which was not ordinary. As to the guilt or innocence of
William of Alderi we have contradictory accounts. One
weighty authority declares him to have been a sharer in
the plot.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_156" id="fnanchor_156"></a><a href="#footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span>
Others class him among many brave and
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
guiltless men who were ruined by the charges brought by
Morel and by Geoffrey of Baynard.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_157" id="fnanchor_157"></a><a href="#footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span>
Guilty or innocent,
he was, we are told, a man of high birth, goodly presence,
and lofty spirit.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_158" id="fnanchor_158"></a><a href="#footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span>
He was moreover the King’s gossip,
bound to him by the same tie which bound Morel to
Malcolm. We thus incidentally learn that there were
those whom William Rufus had held at the font, and for
whose Christian faith and Christian life he had pledged
himself. But the spiritual kindred went for nothing
with the Red King. <span class="sni">The King refuses to spare him.</span>
Many of the great men are said to
have earnestly begged for the life of William of Alderi,
and to have striven to move the King’s greed by a
mighty bribe. The Conqueror had refused Harold’s
weight in gold as the price of his Christian burial;
his son refused three times the weight of William of
Alderi, both in gold and in silver, as the price of
his life.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_159" id="fnanchor_159"></a><a href="#footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></span>
Why Rufus was so bent on his death does
not appear; but nothing could move him. It marks
the way in which the King’s will practically ordered
everything, even in so great an assembly of the realm as
that which had now come together, that William of
Alderi was condemned and hanged without any attempt
to rescue him, though many believed him to be guiltless,
and though powerful men were eager to save him.
<span class="sni">His pious end.</span>
When hope was gone, he made an ending at once as pious
and, according to the ideas of other ages, more manly
than the ending of Waltheof. He confessed his sins to
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
Bishop Osmund, and was, seemingly at his own asking,
scourged in the new-built minster and the other churches
of the city on the waterless hill.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_160" id="fnanchor_160"></a><a href="#footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></span>
Then he gave away
his clothes to the poor, and went naked or slightly clad
to the place of hanging, staining his limbs with blood by
often kneeling on the rough stones.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_161" id="fnanchor_161"></a><a href="#footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></span>
The Bishop and a
crowd of people followed him to the place. He then made
the most solemn protestations of his innocence. The
Bishop sprinkled him with holy water, said the commendatory
prayer, and then withdrew.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_162" id="fnanchor_162"></a><a href="#footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></span>
It was not for Osmund
of Salisbury, whatever it might have been for Odo of
Bayeux or Geoffrey of Coutances, to look on what was
next to come. The work of death was then done, and all
who beheld wondered that not a groan escaped the victim
as death drew near, and not a sigh in the act of dying.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_163" id="fnanchor_163"></a><a href="#footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Last days of William of Eu.</span>
There was thus a marked difference in the fate of the
kinsmen and chief officers of the two leaders, if leaders
they both were, in the conspiracy. The steward and
cousin of William of Eu was done to death, while his
master underwent a fate which to modern ideas seems
worse than death. We are not told how long William of
Eu lived on in blindness and misery; but his punishment
did not involve forfeiture, at all events not corruption
of blood; for a few years later we find his son Henry in
possession of his county.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_164" id="fnanchor_164"></a><a href="#footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></span>

<p class="p2 center">§ 3. <span class="title">The Conquest and Revolt of Wales.</span><br />
1093&ndash;1097.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Relations with Wales.</span>
These years, so rich in events in Scotland and on the
English lands nearest to the Scottish border, were at
least equally rich in events on the other border of the
English kingdom, towards the lands which were still
held by the remnant of our British predecessors. Wars
with the Welsh may be looked for, as a matter of course,
in every reign during this period; but in the reign of
William Rufus such wars form a special feature, and the
position which they hold is a little singular. <span class="sni">Nature of the Welsh wars of Rufus.</span>
It is plain
from the records of the time, it is still plainer from the
results, that this reign was a time of great and lasting
advance at the cost of the Britons. It was the time when
large parts of Wales were more or less fully brought
under the authority of the English crown. <span class="sni">Territorial advance and military ill-success.</span>
It is still more
distinctly the time when Norman adventurers, subjects
of the English crown, carved out for themselves, as its
vassals, possessions and lordships within the British land.
Yet the first impression which we draw from the writers
who record the British warfare of this reign is that it
was a time of ill success on the English side, especially
in those campaigns in which the King himself took
a part. The Chronicler records an expedition, and
he sends up a wail at its ill luck. Nothing came of
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
it; horses and men not a few were lost; the Welsh
escaped to their moors and mountains where no man
might come at them. One chief is put to flight in a
battle, but the others go on doing mischief all the same.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_166" id="fnanchor_166"></a><a href="#footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></span>
The same story comes almost every year; one would
think that the warfare of the Red King with the Welsh
was a warfare than which none was ever more bootless.
And a historian who aspires to more of critical and
philosophical insight sums up the whole British warfare
of the reign as a distinct case of failure.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_167" id="fnanchor_167"></a><a href="#footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></span>
Yet it is clear
from the result that it was not so. And one passage in
the Chronicle seems to give us the key to the whole
matter. “When the King saw that he could there further
nothing of his will, he came back into this land, and took
rede that he might let make castles on the borders.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_168" id="fnanchor_168"></a><a href="#footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Effect of the building of castles.</span>
An expedition which seemed mere failure, in which
many men and horses were lost, while the Welsh escaped
to moors and mountains with hardly any loss at all, was
really successful in the long run, if it led to the building
of a border castle. The Britons fled unhurt to their mountains;
but while they lurked in the fastnesses where
none might come at them, the most valuable part of their
land was taken from them bit by bit. When they came
down again from the mountains, they found a castle built,
they found so much land as the castle could protect
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
changed into a settlement of strangers. The lands might
be harried; the castle might at some favourable moment
be broken down; but it was sure to spring up again and
again to do its work. The lasting possession of the fertile
land had passed away to the invaders; the moors and
mountains alone were left to the sons of the soil.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Welsh campaigns of Harold and of William Rufus.</span>
The mention of these Welsh wars naturally carries us
back to the thought of the great Welsh campaign of a
generation earlier. We see how true, from one point
of view, was the saying of the next century that none
since Harold had known how to deal with the Welsh
as Harold had known.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_169" id="fnanchor_169"></a><a href="#footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></span>
As a matter of military success,
the failures of William Rufus stand out in marked contrast
to the victories of Harold. The Red King had
no pillars to set up to mark where he had overcome
the Briton in open fight.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_170" id="fnanchor_170"></a><a href="#footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></span>
A single word helps us to
at least one part of the cause. <span class="sni">Use of horses.</span>
Harold, in his victorious
campaign, must have undergone some loss of men, but
he underwent no loss of horses. He found that the
English tactics were not suited for British warfare,
and he made his housecarls turn themselves into
light-armed Welshmen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_171" id="fnanchor_171"></a><a href="#footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></span>
But the Norman tactics were
still less suited for British warfare than the English.
There were places in the moors and mountains which
the mailed housecarl might reach, if with difficulty, but
which the mounted knight could not reach at all. But
William Rufus does not seem to have suited his tactics
to the country as Harold had done; the mention of
horses suggests that he repeated the old mistake of
Ralph the Timid in a worse shape.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_172" id="fnanchor_172"></a><a href="#footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Immediate defeat and lasting success.</span>
As a matter of
fighting then, Rufus failed where Harold had succeeded;
but as a matter of enduring conquest, the failures of
Rufus did more than the successes of Harold. Harold
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
indeed had no general schemes of Welsh conquest.
<span class="sni">Different objects of Harold and Rufus.</span>
He overthrew the Welsh; but, except in the districts
which were definitely ceded to England,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_173" id="fnanchor_173"></a><a href="#footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></span>
he made no
attempt to occupy Wales. He gave back the land
whose people he had overcome to princes of their own
blood, bound to him simply by their oath of homage.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_174" id="fnanchor_174"></a><a href="#footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span>
But wherever Rufus or his lords planted a castle, there
was at once a piece of Welsh soil occupied, and a centre
made ready for occupying more. The object of Harold
in short was simply the defence of England; the object
of William Rufus was the conquest of Wales.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Comparison of the conquest of Wales with the English and Norman Conquests.</span>
The conquest which now began, that which we may
call either the English or the Norman Conquest of Wales,
differed widely both from the English Conquest of Britain
and from the Norman Conquest of England. It wrought
far less change than the landing at Ebbsfleet; it wrought
far more change than the landing at Pevensey. The
Briton of those lands which in the Red King’s day
were still British was gradually conquered; he was
gradually brought under English rule and English law;
but he was neither exterminated nor enslaved nor wholly
assimilated. He still abides in his ancient land, still
speaking his ancient tongue. The English or Norman
Conquest of Wales was not a national migration, like
the English Conquest of Britain. Nor was it a conquest
wrought under the guise of an elaborate legal fiction,
like the Norman Conquest of England. William Rufus
did not ask the people of Wales to receive him as their
own lawful king; he did not give himself out to all
mankind as the true heir of Gruffydd the son of Llywelyn,
defrauded of his rights by perjured usurpers. Europe
had passed the stage at which a conquest of the earlier
kind was possible; and there was in this case no excuse
or opportunity for a conquest of the later kind. William
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
Rufus was not a man to seek, like his father, to justify
his acts by legal fictions; nor had he the same room
for devising them as his father had. He had doubtless,
with the crown of the Old-English kings, inherited
their claims to Imperial supremacy over the whole
island; he called himself “Monarch of Britain” no less
than the kings who had gone before him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_175" id="fnanchor_175"></a><a href="#footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span>
But that
monarchy gave him no claim to bring the lands of his
subordinate princes under his immediate rule. If an invasion
of Wales needed any justification in the eyes of
William Rufus and his barons, that justification would
take the shape of reprisals. We may be sure that there
was no moment when the men on the border, either on
the English or the Welsh side, could not have brought
some complaint against the other side which might
have been deemed to justify reprisals by a more scrupulous
prince than the Red King. But for men like
the Norman adventurers of his day it was enough
that a land adjoining to the land which they had
made their own lay open to be conquered. <span class="sni">Geographical conditions of the conquest.</span>
Therein
lay another great difference between this conquest and
either of the other two conquests with which we have
compared it, in the fact that the land to be won lay
adjoining to the land which was already won. The
Angles and Saxons wholly forsook their old homes
beyond the sea, and, if the Normans in England did not
in the same way wholly forsake theirs, the sea at least
rolled between the old home and the new. But the
Norman whose lot was cast on the Welsh frontier of
England had nothing to do but to press on from the
point where he already was. He had simply to add on
the next field to his own field, subject to such resistance
as the actual occupiers of the next field might be able
to make. From this geographical cause, while the
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
Norman Conquest of England was in no sense an extension
of Normandy, the English or Norman Conquest
of Wales was in every sense an extension of England.
<span class="sni">Extension of England by conquest and settlement.</span>
The Normans in England did not bring Normandy with
them; they had from the very beginning to put on more
or less fully the character of Englishmen, and to live
according to English law. But the Norman who from
England went on into Wales had no thought of putting
on the character of a Welshman or of living according to
Welsh law. Wherever he settled, he most truly carried
England with him, such as England had been made through
his own coming. But then for a long time he settled only
here and there in the British land. Where he did settle,
the speech, the laws, the national life, of the Briton passed
away in such sort as the speech, the laws, the national life,
of the Englishman never at any moment passed away
from England. But alongside of these conquered districts
there long remained independent districts, where the
natives under their native princes still bade defiance to
the invaders. England had already an uniform aspect;
it was the old England with certain changes; its laws
were the laws of King Eadward with the amendments of
King William. Wales, for a long while after the time
with which we are now dealing, was as far from
uniformity as any land east of the Hadriatic. <span class="sni">Various elements in Wales.</span>
Here
was the castle of the Norman lord, with his following,
Norman, English, Flemish, anything but British. Here
was the newly-founded town, with its free burghers, again
Norman, English, Flemish, anything but British. Here
again was a whole district from which the Briton had
passed away as thoroughly as he had passed away from
Kent or Norfolk, but which the Norman had not taken
into his own hands. <span class="sni">The Flemings.</span>
He had found that it suited his purpose
to leave it in the hands of the hardy and industrious
Fleming, the last wave of Low-Dutch occupation in the
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
isle of Britain. And alongside of all, there was the
still independent Briton, still keeping his moors and
mountains, still ready to pour down from them upon
the richer lands which had been his fathers’, but which
had passed into the stranger’s grasp. Those days have
long passed away; for three centuries and more Briton
and Englishmen have been willing members of a common
state, willing subjects of a common sovereign. But the
memory of those days has not passed away; it abides
in the most living of all witnesses. <span class="sni">Endurance of the Welsh language.</span>
England has for ages
spoken a single tongue, her own ancient speech, modified
by the coming of the conquerors of eight hundred years ago.
But in Wales the speech of her conquerors, the speech
of England, is still only making its way, slowly and
fitfully, against the abiding resistance of that stubborn
British tongue which has survived <em>three</em> conquests.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_176" id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Local nomenclature of Wales.</span>
The results of this state of things, where so many contending
elements so long stood side by side, are still to
be seen on the face of the British land. The local
nomenclature of Wales tells a wholly different tale from
that of England. <span class="sni">Contrast with that of England.</span>
In England the nomenclature is everywhere
essentially Teutonic; we might say that it is
everywhere essentially English; for the names given by
the Danes form one class along with those given by the
Angles and Saxons, as opposed either to Celtic survivals
or to Romance intruders. Both these two last classes
are in England mere exceptions to the general law of
Teutonic nomenclature. <span class="sni">Teutonic and French names.</span>
But in Wales, while the great
majority of the names are Celtic, the Teutonic names are
somewhat more than exceptions. In some districts, as
I have already said, they are the all but invariable
rule. French names, too, though not very common, are,
I think, less rare than in England. <span class="sni">Places bearing two names.</span>
Nothing is more
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
common than for a place to bear different names, according
as English or Welsh is spoken. And these names
sometimes translate one another, and sometimes do not.
All this is natural in a land where distinct and hostile
races so long dwelled side by side, each one a thorn in
the side of the others. It marks a kind of conquest
different alike from the conquest where the conquered
vanish from the soil and from the conquest where they
swallow up their conquerors.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The Welsh castles.</span>
There is again a visible feature, one so characteristic of
the scenery of Wales as to be all but a natural feature,
which arises out of the nature of the conquest with which
we have now to deal. The traveller who comes back, I will
not say from the land of the Grey Leagues, but from that
nearer land of Maine with which our tale will soon have
so much to do, to one of the hilly districts of England,
feels something missing in the landscape, or in the
memories called up by the landscape. On the isolated
hill, on the bluff which ends the long ridge, he comes
instinctively to look for the shattered castle or for the
lines which show that the castle once stood there. <span class="sni">Lack of castles in England.</span>
It is
one of the special signs of what English history has been,
one of the signs which should make us thankful that it
has been what it has been, that in England those bluffs,
those island hills, on which the castle or its traces can
still be seen, are in truth few and far between. After all
that we hear of castles and castle-builders, the castle was,
at any moment of English history save the nineteen
years of anarchy, a rare thing in England compared to
what it was in other lands. <span class="sni">Houses in England.</span>
Save where there was a
town to protect or to keep in obedience, save where there
was some special post of military strength that needed to
be guarded, the lord of an English lordship, in whichever
host his forefather had fought on Senlac, found that a
simple manor, sheltered perhaps by some slight defence,
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
served his purpose as well as the threatening tower. <span class="sni">Border castles.</span>
On
all the borderlands it was otherwise; the pele-tower of
the north is but the Norman keep on a miniature scale.
And, above all, Wales is, as every one knows, pre-eminently
the land of castles. Through those districts with
which we are specially concerned, castles, great and
small, or the ruins or traces of such castles, meet us at
every step. It was needful to strengthen every height,
to guard every pass, while the moors and mountains, the
Asturias or the Tzernagora of the Cymry, still remained
unsubdued. The castles are in truth the leading architectural
features of the country; the churches, mostly small
and plain, might themselves, with their fortified towers,
almost count as castles. <span class="sni">The Welsh towns.</span>
The towns, almost always of
English foundation, were mostly small; they were military
colonies rather than seats of commerce. As Wales
had no immemorial cities like Exeter and Lincoln, so she
had no towns which sprang up into greatness in later
times, like Bristol, Norwich, and Coventry. Every memorial
of former days which we see in the British land
reminds us how long warfare remained the daily business
alike of the men of that land and of the strangers who
had made their way into it at the sword’s point.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Advance before the accession of Rufus.</span>
We have seen that neither the days of Eadward nor
the days of the elder William were days of peace along
the Welsh border. The English frontier had advanced

But real conquest
does not seem to have gone very far beyond the border
fortresses, as within the <em>march</em> of the Marquess of
Rhuddlan it did not go very far from the coast. In
the days of the rebellion we have seen that the hearts
of the Cymry rose again, and that they again ventured
on offensive warfare with no small effect. They and their
Scandinavian allies had broken the power and taken away
the life of the man who had so long kept their northern
tribes in awe. <span class="sni">Rhys ap Tewdwr.</span>
In that work we have seen that Rhys ap

<p><span class="sni">Beginning of the Conquest of South Wales. 1093.</span>
It seems to have been in the year of Anselm’s appointment,
the year of Malcolm’s death, that the conquest of
South Wales began in earnest. It seems now to have
been for the first time taken up by the King as part of
the affairs of his kingdom. But the geography of the
campaign shows that a gradual advance must have
already begun along the south coast. Our public entries
are concerned only with the land stretching nearly due
west, from the mountains of Brecknock and Abergavenny
to the Land’s End of Saint David’s. This leaves out
the sea-land which, with the bold curve of its coast,
projects to the south, the land of Morganwg or Glamorgan.
Yet it may be taken as a matter of course that this
land was not left to be won later than inland Brecheiniog
and far distant Dyfed. <span class="sni">Legend of the conquest of Glamorgan.</span>
The unlucky thing is that,
while the conquest of Brecheiniog and Dyfed is recorded
in notices which, though meagre enough, are fully trustworthy
as far as they go, the conquest of Morganwg,
strangely left out in all authentic records, has become
the subject of an elaborate romance which has stepped
into the empty place of the missing history. The romance
is, as usual, the invention of pedigree-makers, working,
after their manner, to exalt the glory and increase the
antiquity of this and that local family. This is perhaps
the meanest of the many forms of falsehood against
which the historian has to strive; but it is also one of
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
the strongest and most abiding, and one which is specially
strong and abiding on the northern coast of the Bristol
Channel.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_188" id="fnanchor_188"></a><a href="#footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The legend pieces itself on to that point of the genuine
history when the sons of Cedivor were defeated by
Rhys ap Tewdwr. <span class="sni">Story of Jestin and Einion.</span>
A brother of Cedivor, Einion by
name, who had been in the service of either the elder or
the younger William, and had served the King in his
continental wars, now flees to another enemy of Rhys,
Jestin son of Gwrgan, described as prince of Gwent
and Morganwg.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_189" id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span>
Jestin promises his daughter to Einion
with an ample estate, if he can obtain help from England
against the common enemy Rhys. This, it is supposed,
Einion’s friendship with the King and his knights will
enable him to do. Nor was Jestin’s hope disappointed.
<span class="sni">Story of Robert Fitz-hamon and his knights.</span>
No less a man than Robert Fitz-hamon hearkened to the
invitation of Einion; he set out at the head of a company
of twelve knights and their followers to give help to the
prince of Morganwg. Their joint forces overcame Rhys
in a battle on the borders of Brecheiniog, and Rhys
himself, flying from the field, was taken and beheaded.
His kinsmen and followers seem to have been killed
or dispersed, and we are told that Robert Fitz-hamon
and his companions, being well paid for their services
by Jestin, went away towards London. Then Einion
demands his reward; but Jestin says that he will not
give either his daughter or his land to a traitor. <span class="sni">Einion recalls Robert.</span>
Then
Einion persuades Robert and his companions to come
back, and take Jestin’s dominions for themselves. They
are of course in no way unwilling; and they are joined
by some of Jestin’s Welsh enemies. Jestin is driven
out, and his land is partitioned. The rough mountain
land is assigned to Einion and his Welsh companions,
and Einion also marries Nest the daughter of Jestin.
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
Robert Fitz-hamon and his twelve knights divide the
fertile vale of Glamorgan among them. <span class="sni">Division of Glamorgan.</span>
Each man
establishes himself in a lordship and castle, and all do
homage to Robert as lord of Glamorgan, holding his
chief seat in his castle of Cardiff. <span class="sni">Share kept by the children of Jestin.</span>
But, while the traitor
Einion obtains so sorry a portion, a son of Jestin is
admitted to a share in the rich vale, and is allowed to
hand on his lordship to his descendants. Another of the
family, a grandson of Jestin, Gruffydd son of Rhydderch,
refuses to submit, withstands the invaders in arms, contrives
to defend Caerleon, and to hand on to his son Caradoc
a principality in Gwent, seemingly east of the Usk.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Estimate of the story.</span>
Now how much of this story is to be believed? Jestin
is a most shadowy being, of whom personally nothing
is recorded. But there is evidence enough for the
existence of his descendants, and for their retention of
an important lordship in Glamorgan.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_190" id="fnanchor_190"></a><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span>
This may make
us inclined to put some faith in the account of the
transactions between Jestin, Einion, and Robert Fitz-hamon.
<span class="sni">Elements of truth.</span>
The general outline of the tale is perfectly
possible, except the very unlikely story that Robert or
any other Norman, when once standing in arms on
British or any other ground, simply marched out again
after receiving a fair day’s wages for a fair day’s work.
<span class="sni">Settlement of Robert Fitz-hamon at Cardiff.</span>
That Robert Fitz-hamon did conquer Glamorgan and
establish himself at Cardiff cannot be doubted. The
settlement of some of his followers is equally historical;
but the list of them as given in the legend is untrustworthy,
<span class="sni">Legendary names in the list.</span>
as containing names of families which did not
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
appear in the district till later. That the Normans were
invited by a Welsh prince to help him against his enemies,
and that they then took his lands to themselves, is quite
possible, though the story rests on no certain evidence.
That the Norman invaders took the valuable land, the
fertile vale, to themselves, and left the rugged mountains
to the Britons, is doubtless a true description of the
general result, though it is not likely to have been caused
by any formal division. The only thing to suggest such
a division is the portion which was kept by the descendants
of Jestin. But such an anomaly as this last might
be accounted for in various ways. The defeat and death
of Rhys in Brecheiniog is beyond doubt, and it is not
unlikely that Robert Fitz-hamon may have had a hand
in it; but at all events the date is utterly wrong.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_191" id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Question of Jestin’s descendants.</span>
The
most unlikely part of the story is that which describes
a grandson of Jestin as founding a principality in that
part of Gwent which had already long been an English
possession. This story might almost seem to be a confusion
with an event of earlier times. We are tempted
to think that the Caradoc son of Gruffydd and grandson
of Rhydderch, who now settles himself in Gwent, is a
mythical repetition of the Caradoc son of Gruffydd and
grandson of Rhydderch who destroyed King Eadward’s
hunting-seat at Portskewet.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_192" id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span></p>

These made him great in the shires of
Gloucester and Somerset, shires from which he might look
with a longing eye towards the lands beyond the Severn
and the Severn sea. To these, it appears, was added the
honour of Gloucester, or rather the lands of Brihtric were
made into an honour of Gloucester for his benefit.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_197" id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span>

and so
had the privilege of being brother-in-law to Robert of

occasion to notice, the wife of King Henry’s son Robert,
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
with whom Gloucester became an earldom. <span class="sni">His works at Gloucester and Tewkesbury.</span>
He founded
the abbey of Tewkesbury, one of the line of great religious
houses along the Severn, where his work may
still be seen in the vast pillars and mysterious front of his
still surviving minster.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_200" id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span>
To the older abbey of Gloucester
he was a bountiful benefactor. And the nature of his
gifts to these two favoured houses would be almost
enough of itself to enable us to set down Robert Fitz-hamon
as conqueror of Glamorgan. <span class="sni">Grant of Welsh churches to English monasteries.</span>
Gloucester and
Tewkesbury were enriched at the cost of the churches
of Glamorgan, proof enough that he who could thus
enrich them had won great possessions in Glamorgan.
The holy places of the Briton, Llantwit and Llancarfan,
with a crowd of churches of lesser note, supplied
the conqueror with an easy means of being bountiful
with no cost to himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_201" id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span>
So again the mere fact that
a man who held such a position as that of Robert Fitz-hamon,
one who, though not an earl, ranked by possessions
and connexions alongside of earls, plays so small
a part as he does in the recorded history of the reign,
might almost of itself suggest that he was busy on some
enterprise of his own, such as that which legend assigns
to him. <span class="sni">Conquest of Glamorgan.</span>
When the mound by the swift and shallow
Taff was crowned by the shell-keep of Cardiff, the
progress of invasion was not likely to tarry. The fertile
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
lowlands from the mouth of the Taff to the mouth of
the Neath were a natural accession to the lowlands of
Gwent which were already won. They were won;
they were guarded by a crowd of castles. <span class="sni">Building of castles.</span>
And the
winning of the land, the building of the castles, events
about which the genuine local history is strangely silent,
were, there is not the slightest reason to doubt, the work
of Robert Fitz-hamon and of the men who shared with
him in that work.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Distinction between Morganwg and Glamorgan.</span>
In strict geographical accuracy the names <span class="title">Morganwg</span>
and <span class="title">Glamorgan</span> do not answer to one another.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_202" id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span>
Morganwg
in the wider sense is said to have taken in a
vast district from the Severn to the Towy, while Glamorgan,
said to be called from a prince named Morgan
in the tenth century, was less than the present county,
taking in only the vale. The distinction between the
two was preserved in the style of the lords of “Morgania
and Glamorgania.” <span class="sni">Extent of Glamorgan.</span>
But the country with which we
have now to deal may be practically looked on as
answering to the present county, somewhat cut short
to the west and somewhat lengthened to the east. It
takes in the present Monmouthshire between Usk and
Rhymny; it does not take in the peninsula of Gower.
This last, with the town of Swansea on its isthmus,
still forms no part of the diocese of Glamorgan or
Llandaff; it marks its formerly distinct character by still
belonging to the diocese of Saint David’s. Within this district
Robert Fitz-hamon and his successors the Earls of
Gloucester held a position like that of the Earl of Chester
or the Bishop of Durham. Without bearing their lofty
titles, the Lord of Glamorgan practically held, like them,
a vassal principality of the crown. Like the other lords
marchers, he held most of the powers of kingship within
his lordship, and the position of his lordship enabled
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
him to carry out those powers more thoroughly than most
of his fellows.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_203" id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Cardiff castle.</span>
The chief seat of the lord was at Cardiff
on the Taff, where the castle had been, as we have seen,
founded in the Conqueror’s day.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_204" id="fnanchor_204"></a><a href="#footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Bishopric of Llandaff.</span>
A little higher up the
river was the seat of the bishopric of Glamorgan at
Llandaff, with its church, most unlike Le Mans or Durham,
nestling by the river at the foot of the hill. Under
the chief lord settled several lesser lords, tenants-in-chief,
we may almost venture to call them, within Glamorgan,
who founded castles and families, and under
whom the land was again divided among a crowd of
smaller tenants. Some of these lesser lords held within
their own lordships powers almost equal to those of the
lord of Glamorgan himself. <span class="sni">William of London.</span>
First perhaps among them
was the house founded by William of London, better
known under the French form of <span class="place" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Londres</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_205" id="fnanchor_205"></a><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span>
The name
suggests some thoughts. Who was a William of London
in the days of William Rufus? A Norman doubtless,
but hardly a Norman of any very lofty rank in his own
land. May we follow the analogy of the great bearer of
the same name in the next age, and see in him the son
of a Rouen citizen settled in London in the very first
days of the Conquest, or even in the days of the Confessor?
<span class="sni">Kidwelly and Ogmore.</span>
The house of London spread beyond the bounds
of Glamorgan; their chief seat was at Kidwelly; but
within the lordship of Fitz-hamon the square keep of
Ogmore and the fortified priory of Ewenny, one of the
most precious specimens of the Norman minster on the
smallest scale, still remain as memorials of their presence.
<span class="sni">Richard Siward.</span>
But the name of Siward&mdash;&#8203;its first bearer appears in the
legend as Richard Siward&mdash;&#8203;bespeaks English or Danish
descent, and we are tempted to see in the colonist of
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>

with the conquerors. They alone shared the fertile
plain with the strangers; the rest of their countrymen,
even those who held acknowledged lands and lordships,
were confined to the barren hills.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_207" id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">The lords and their castles.</span>
These few families have each something in their name
and history which entitles them to special notice. A few
others were of really equal eminence from the first, and
the legend, to make up the full tale of twelve peers,
adds on several names of later date. These great lords,
and a crowd of smaller land-owners as well, built each
man his castle; in Glamorgan the peaceful manor-house,
soon to become the rule in England, seems to have been
the reform of a much later day. The castles with
which we are to deal are of course for the most part
castles of the older and simpler type; it was not till
long after the times with which we are dealing that
Caerphilly, with its mighty gateway-towers, its princely
hall, its lake wrought by the hand of man, became the
proudest of South-Welsh fortresses, the peer of Caernarvon
itself. Caerphilly lies indeed beyond our immediate
range, in the land still left to the natives, parted off by
hills from Cardiff and from the rich plain which the conquerors
kept for themselves. Not a few others of the
famous castles of the district belong to times far too
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
late for us. <span class="sni">The South-Welsh churches.</span>
From the castles the churches also caught
a military air, and kept it during the whole time of
mediæval architecture. The fortified towers of Glamorgan
have the military character less strongly marked
than the towers of Pembrokeshire; but it is marked
quite strongly enough to strike the English visitor as
something altogether in harmony with the endless
traces of castles which meet him at every step. He sees
at once that a state of things which in England
existed only during the first years of the Conquest, or
which more truly, unless during the nineteen years of
anarchy, never existed at all, went on in the half conquered
British land for ages.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Saxon settlements in South-Wales.</span>
The leaders in the settlement were of course mainly
Norman. It has been acutely remarked that they mostly
came, as followers of Robert Fitz-hamon most naturally
<a name="line88_17" id="line88_17"></a>would come, from the old lands of Brihtric in Gloucestershire
and Somerset. They doubtless brought with them
an English following, a strictly Saxon invasion of South
Wales. Among the Teutonic settlers in this district,
it is not easy to distinguish the Saxon from the Fleming.
<span class="sni">The Flemings in Pembrokeshire.</span>
It must always be remembered that, while the Flemish
settlement in Pembrokeshire is matter of history, the
Flemish settlements in Gower and Glamorgan are merely
matters of inference.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_208" id="fnanchor_208"></a><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Foundation of boroughs.</span>
The English and Flemish settlers
were doubtless the chief inhabitants of the boroughs
which now began to arise under the shadow of the castles.
Cardiff, Kenfig, Aberafan, and Neath, arose on the coast or
on the rivers from which some of them took their names.
Cowbridge and Llantrissant lay in the inland part of the
vale; the last, a borough mainly British, was the only one
which held at all a commanding site among the hills.
In later times these towns sank into insignificance&mdash;&#8203;Kenfig
indeed well nigh perished under heaps of sand.
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
But some of them have in later times been called up to
a new life by the wonderful development of mineral
wealth which has changed the barren hills which were
left to the Briton into one of the busiest regions of our
whole island.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Ecclesiastical affairs.</span>
In ecclesiastical matters the conquest of this district
was for awhile chiefly marked, as has been mentioned,
by the spoliation of the ancient British foundations,
to the behoof of the conqueror’s favourite monasteries
at Gloucester and Tewkesbury. <span class="sni">Llandaff.</span>
The bishopric of Llandaff
or Glamorgan kept its place, though it never became,
either in the extent of its possessions or in the
fabric of its church, at all the peer of Saint David’s.
<span class="sni">Ewenny. Cistercian foundations.</span>
Ewenny arose, if not in the very first days of the conquest,
yet within the first or second generation.
The Cistercian
movement reached this district early. <span class="sni">Neath. 1130.</span>
The abbey
of Neath arose in King Henry’s time, under the patronage
of Earl Robert;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_209" id="fnanchor_209"></a><a href="#footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></span>
and in the last year of his life, while
the anarchy still raged, the same earl, the most renowned
of the lords of Glamorgan, <span class="sni">Margam. 1147.</span>
found means to found the
more famous abbey of Margam.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_210" id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The conquest of Glamorgan thus stands out as an
event which is altogether unrecorded in authentic history,
but of which it is not hard to put together a picture
from its results. Other parts of the conquest of South
Wales are more clearly entered in both British and
English annals. <span class="sni">Conquest of Brecknock.</span>
The mountain land of Brecheiniog
must have been occupied early in the reign of Rufus,
if not earlier still. <span class="sni">Bernard Newmarch.</span>
Its conqueror, Bernard of Neufmarché,
better known in the English form of <span class="place">Newmarch</span>,
has already figured in our story;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_211" id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span>
and he was clearly
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
in possession when William Rufus lay sick and penitent
at Gloucester. His followers are then spoken of as the
French who inhabited Brecheiniog. By that time then
the upper valley of the Usk, from Abergavenny westward,
must have been already subdued. The rich land
of the holy King Brychan, with his twenty-four sainted
daughters&mdash;&#8203;the church where the worship of one of them
turned the people of the land into frenzies which offended
the soberer devotion of the Norman<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_212" id="fnanchor_212"></a><a href="#footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;the rivers full of
fish, the lake of marvels, the whole pleasant valley cut
off by its hills from the extremes of heat and cold<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_213" id="fnanchor_213"></a><a href="#footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;all
had passed away from British rule. <span class="sni">The castle of Brecknock.</span>
Bernard had doubtless
by this time reared on the hill of Aberhonwy at
least some rude forerunner of the castle of Brecknock,
the fragments of which still stand, facing the southern
mountains, alongside of the massive church of his own
priory, the church which he made his far-off offering
to Saint Martin of the Place of Battle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_214" id="fnanchor_214"></a><a href="#footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Bernard’s gifts to Battle Abbey.</span>
We know not
whether Bernard had by this time striven to confirm his
power on British soil by a marriage which connected him
with the noblest blood, alike British and English. <span class="sni">His wife Nest.</span>
His
wife Nest united the blood of Gruffydd with the blood of
Ælfgar. We are not told the name or race of her father;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_215" id="fnanchor_215"></a><a href="#footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></span>
but her mother was Nest the daughter of Gruffydd and
Ealdgyth, the stepdaughter of Harold, the half-sister of
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
his twin wanderers, the granddaughter of Ælfgar and
his perhaps Norman Ælfgifu.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_216" id="fnanchor_216"></a><a href="#footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></span>
Nest thus came on the
spindle-side from Godgifu the mirror of English matronhood;
but the woman who shamelessly avowed to King
Henry that her son was not the son of her husband
Bernard hardly walked in the steps of her renowned
ancestress.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_217" id="fnanchor_217"></a><a href="#footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></span>
During that memorable Lent, while King
William lay sick at Gloucester, the new lord of Brecknock
found it needful to gather his strength to withstand an
attack from the people whom he had despoiled. <span class="sni">Defeat and death of Rhys at Brecknock. 1093.</span>
The
Britons came together under Rhys the son of Tewdwr, the
king of whom we have often heard, and who must have
been at this time the most powerful prince of South Wales.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_218" id="fnanchor_218"></a><a href="#footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></span>
He invaded the invaders; and in the very Easter week,
while matters were busy between William and Anselm
on the one hand, between William and Malcolm on
the other hand, a battle took place near Brecknock.
There Rhys was killed, by the help, according to the
Glamorgan legend, of Robert Fitz-hamon. According to
the same legend, Rhys did not fall in open fight, but as
a prisoner to whom quarter was refused. Another
account describes him as being slain by the treachery
of his own men. His death was marked as an epoch
in the history of Wales. <span class="sni">End of “the kingdom of the Britons.”</span>
With him, the native historian
writes, fell the kingdom of the Britons, a phrase which
an English writer seems to have misunderstood as
meaning that after him no Welsh prince bore the kingly

title.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_219" id="fnanchor_219"></a><a href="#footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></span>
The overthrow of Rhys led to great movements
in other parts of South Wales. <span class="sni">Effect of the death of Rhys.</span>
We can hardly doubt
that, whether Robert Fitz-hamon had a hand in the
fight at Brecknock or not, his settlement in Glamorgan
was at any rate already begun. But the fall of Rhys
laid the lands to the south-west, the lands of Ceredigion
and Dyfed, open to invasion; and two sets of invaders
were equally ready to make the most of the chance
which was now laid open to them. The British enemy
came first. <span class="sni">Cadwgan harries Dyfed. April 30, 1093.</span>
Cadwgan son of Bleddyn, who had once
before driven Rhys from his throne,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_220" id="fnanchor_220"></a><a href="#footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></span>
seized the moment
of his death to carry a wasting inroad into Dyfed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_221" id="fnanchor_221"></a><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span>
He
was presently followed by invaders who were to do
something more than make a wasting inroad. <span class="sni">Norman conquest of Ceredigion and Dyfed. July 1, 1093.</span>
“About the
kalends of July the French for the first time held Dyfed
and Ceredigion, and set castles in them, and thence
occupied the whole land.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_222" id="fnanchor_222"></a><a href="#footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>These words of the British annalist mark a most important
stage in the occupation of his country. The campaign
of this summer completed the conquest of South
Wales, so far as a land could be said to be conquered which
was always revolting, and where native chiefs still kept,
sometimes by their own strength, sometimes by formal
acknowledgement, such parts of the land as the invaders
could not or did not care to occupy. But it was now
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
that a land was planted with castles which is still pre-eminently
the land of castles; <span class="sni">Pembrokeshire.</span>
it was now that a land
was brought under the power of those who bore rule
in England which was itself to become a new England
beyond the line of the Briton. Ceredigion, the land of
Cardigan, the vale of Teifi with its still abiding beavers,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_223" id="fnanchor_223"></a><a href="#footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></span>
the sites of the castles of Aberystwyth and Cilgerran, of
the abbey of Strata Florida and the priory of Saint Dogmael,
were added to the dominion of the conquerors.
Thence they pressed on to the extreme south-western
land, and added Dyfed by a new name to the possessions
of the English crown. <span class="sni">Tale of Rufus’ threats against Ireland.</span>
A tale has been told how the
Red King himself made his way to the most western
point of all, to the headland of Saint David’s; there,
from the treeless rocks, he looked over the sea to the
land beyond, which may now and then be seen on a
cloudless evening. Then he boasted that, lord as he
was of Britain, he would be lord of Ireland too, how he
would gather round that headland the fleets of his whole
kingdom, and would make of them a bridge by which
he might pass over and win the great island for himself.
The tale goes on to tell how, when the threatening
words were brought to King Murtagh,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_224" id="fnanchor_224"></a><a href="#footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></span>
he asked whether
the King of the English had added to his threat the
words, “If God will?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_225" id="fnanchor_225"></a><a href="#footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span>
The Red King had not used
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
the formula which he hated to hear even from the lips
of others,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_226" id="fnanchor_226"></a><a href="#footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></span>
and the Irish prince at once answered that
he did not fear the coming of one who meant to come
only in his own strength, and not in that of the Most
High.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_227" id="fnanchor_227"></a><a href="#footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Estimate of the story.</span>
The tale is eminently characteristic of William Rufus;
yet it sounds somewhat like an echo of the real visit
and the real schemes of the great William translated
into the boastful language of his son. The Conqueror
did visit Saint David’s;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_228" id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></span>
he did plan the conquest of
Ireland;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_229" id="fnanchor_229"></a><a href="#footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></span>
but it is not likely that he threw the
expression of his designs into such a shape as that
which William Rufus would have been likely enough
to choose. The younger William may have made
his way to Saint David’s; but it is not easy to find
a time for his coming, either in this year or in any
other. <span class="sni">Acquisition of Saint David’s.</span>
But, whether through his coming or not, Saint
David’s itself passed under the obedience of the conquerors.
<span class="sni">Bishop Wilfrith.</span>
We presently find its bishop, a bishop spoken
of as a Briton, but bearing the English name of Wilfrith,
acting in their full confidence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_230" id="fnanchor_230"></a><a href="#footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></span>
But the holy place,
deep in its hollow, was left to be guarded by its own
holiness. No castle of king or earl or sheriff invaded
its precincts; the home of its bishop did not, as at
Llandaff, take the form of a castle looking down upon
the minster, but that of a peaceful palace resting by
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
its side. The conquerors pressed on, through the land
of Cemaes and Emlyn and by the hills of Preseleu,
till they reached the south-western land, the land of
creeks and peninsulas, where the tides of Ocean rise
and fall beneath the walls of far inland towns and
fortresses. <span class="sni">Milford Haven.</span>
In those waters the wandering wiking had
seen the likeness of his own fiords, and he had left his
mark here and there on a <dfn>holm</dfn>, a <dfn>gard</dfn>, a <dfn>thorp</dfn>, a <dfn>ford</dfn>,
some of them bearing names which seem to go back
to the gods of Scandinavian heathendom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_231" id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></span>
The Norman
won the land, to hand it over in the next reign to the
Flemish settlers, who rooted out whatever traces of the
Cymry Northmen and Normans had left. Two of the
chief towns, Pembroke and Tenby, kept their British
names in corrupt forms.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_232" id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span>
Milford and Haverford would
seem to have been already named by the Northmen. <span class="sni">The Pembrokeshire castles.</span>
On
every tempting point overlooking the inland waters, sometimes
on points overlooking the Ocean itself, castles arose,
some of which grew into the very stateliest of their own
class. Tenby, Haverfordwest&mdash;&#8203;Manorbeer, birthplace of
Giraldus<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_233" id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;Caerau, connected with so many famous names
of later date<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_234" id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;and a crowd of castles of lesser note,
witness the means by which the conquerors knew how to
hold down the land which they had won.</p>

<p>At the head of all stands the great fortress which
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
gave its name to a town, a shire, and a long line of
earls, and in our own time to a great workshop of the
naval strength of the land. <span class="sni">Pembroke Castle.</span>
<span class="place">Pen bro</span>, the head of the
sealand, grew into Pembroke, with its vast castle rising
on a peninsula above two arms of the inland sea&mdash;&#8203;with
its stately hall looking down on the waters&mdash;&#8203;with the
deep cave underneath its walls, with the huge mass of the
round tower&mdash;&#8203;with the one hill-side covered by the houses
and churches of the town, the other crowned by the
long line of the priory of Monkton, with its stern
square tower and its now roofless choir. <span class="sni">Pembrokeshire buildings.</span>
The character
of military strength and simplicity, which is stamped
in a lesser measure on the churches and houses of
Glamorgan, comes out in all its fulness in the churches
and houses of Pembrokeshire. Of all this the days of
which we are speaking saw the beginnings, but only
the beginnings. <span class="sni">The castle begun by Arnulf of Montgomery.</span>
On the tongue of land between the
two creeks a fortress was raised by Arnulf of Montgomery,
son of Roger and Mabel, a man of whom we
have already heard and shall hear again. But his
defences were as yet small and feeble as compared with
what was to follow; the first castle of Pembroke was
a mere earthwork with a palisade.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_235" id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Second building of Gerald of Windsor. 1105.</span>
Arnulf placed his

of greater strength on the same spot.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_236" id="fnanchor_236"></a><a href="#footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His wife Nest.</span>
In after times
he married a wife of the noblest British blood, yet
another Nest, the daughter of Rhys son of Tewdwr, and
grandchild through her mother of that Rhiwallon who
had received a kingdom at the hands of Harold.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_237" id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></span>
Before
her marriage she was the mother of one of the sons of
King Henry, though assuredly not of the great Earl of
Gloucester.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_238" id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span>
In later days, through another marriage,
she became the grandmother of Giraldus Cambrensis.</p>

<p>The course of events in North Wales during these
years is less easy to mark with exact dates. But it
is plain that the death of Robert of Rhuddlan had been
only a momentary triumph for the Cymry, and that
it had not given any real check to the Norman power.
<span class="sni">Hugh of Chester in Anglesey.</span>
Earl Hugh of Chester, strong on the border of the
continental Britons, still held a hand no less firm on
their island kinsfolk. <span class="sni">Castle of Aberlleiniog.</span>
He even pressed on into Anglesey,
and there built a castle, most likely at Aberlleiniog on
the eastern coast of the island, a spot of which we shall
have to speak again more fully in recording a memorable
day later in our story. <span class="sni">Advance of Earl Roger in Powys.</span>
Earl Roger meanwhile, from

pushed on his dominion into

The conquest of Wales was thus, to all appearance,
nearly complete. <span class="sni">Seeming conquest of Wales.</span>
The two great earls were going on
with their old work in the north, while in the south
the tide of conquest was advancing with such speed
as it had never advanced before. In the south-east
Gwent and Morganwg seemed to be firmly held, while
in the south-west the torrent of Norman invasion had
rushed by a single burst from the hill of Brecknock
to the furthest coast of Dyfed. In the south at least
the only independent region left was that which lies
between the conquest of Robert Fitz-hamon and the
conquest of Arnulf of Montgomery. <span class="sni">Gower and Caermarthen unsubdued.</span>
Gower, with its

conquered land beyond the bay&mdash;&#8203;the whole range too
of coast with its sandy estuaries, from the mouth by
Llwchr to the mouth by Laugharne&mdash;&#8203;Kidwelly also, not
yet crowned by the gem of South-Welsh castles&mdash;&#8203;Caermarthen

Otherwise the Britons might truly say with
their chronicler that on the death of Rhys their kingdom
passed away from them. <span class="sni">1093&ndash;1094.</span>
So things slept while Anselm

But when the king was beyond

Earl, the father of both of them, had died with the cowl

that the hour of deliverance was come. The English
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">99</span>
Chronicler, though he does not at this stage help us to
the names of British men or of British places, paints
the general picture in his strongest colours; <span class="sni">Revolt of the Welsh. 1094.</span>
“The
Welshmen gathered themselves together, and on the
French that were in Wales or the nighest parts and
had ere taken away their lands, they upheaved war,
and castles they broke and men they offslew, and as
their host waxed, they <dfn>todealed</dfn> themselves into more.
With some of those <dfn>deals</dfn> fought Hugh Earl of Shropshire
and put them to flight. And none the less the
others all this year never left off from none evil that
they might do.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_242" id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>In this version the Norman or English champion
stands clearly forth. We see that Earl Hugh had sharp
work upon his hands from the moment that he stepped
into his father’s earldom. The British writers give us a
clearer sight of the geographical extent of the movement,
and they help us to the name of its chief leader. <span class="sni">Cadwgan son of Bleddyn.</span>
This
was Cadwgan son of Bleddyn, whom we last heard of as
harrying Dyfed, and who even now seems at least as
anxious to make Dyfed a land subject to Gwynedd as to
drive Normans, English, or Flemings, out of either. Thus
the Britons were, as ever, in the words of the Chronicler,
<dfn>todealed</dfn>; they were divided into local and dynastic
parties. <span class="sni">Divisions of the Welsh.</span>
Yet, as he puts it, even this division, if it
did not give strength, at least delayed subjection. If
Earl Hugh or any other leader of a regular force was
able to overthrow one <dfn>deal</dfn>, another <dfn>deal</dfn> was ready all
the same to do as much evil as before. But it was in
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
Gwynedd and under Cadwgan that the work began.
<span class="sni">General revolt of Wales.</span>
The Britons could not bear the yoke of the French;
they rose, they broke down the castles, and, as men
commonly do in such cases, they did by the invaders
as the invaders had done by them. It is not very
wonderful if, in their hour of victory, they revenged the
reavings and slaughters done on them by the French
with new reavings and slaughters done on the French
themselves.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_243" id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span>
And, as our Chronicler hints, it was not
only on the French within Wales, but on those also in
the nighest parts that they rose. By this time the whole
land had risen; South-Welsh and West-Welsh&mdash;&#8203;that is
now no longer the men of the peninsula of Cornwall, but
the men of the peninsula of Dyfed&mdash;&#8203;were in arms no less
than the men of Gwynedd. <span class="sni">Invasion of England.</span>
Gruffydd and Cadwgan burst
into the neighbouring shires, Cheshire, Shropshire, and
Herefordshire; they burned towns, carried off plunder,
and slew Frenchmen and Englishmen alike.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_244" id="fnanchor_244"></a><a href="#footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></span>
The Saxon,
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
the old enemy, had not become less an enemy, because
he had, through his own conquest, become an accomplice
in the invasions of his conquerors. <span class="sni">Deliverance of Anglesey.</span>
Gwynedd was now
free; the deliverers crossed into Anglesey; <span class="sni">Aberlleiniog castle broken down.</span>
they broke
down the castle at Aberlleiniog or elsewhere, and put an
end for a while to the foreign dominion in the island.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_245" id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The Britons now seemed to have altogether undone
the work of the invaders. It was now time for vigorous
action on the other side. The French&mdash;&#8203;Hugh of Chester,
Hugh of Shrewsbury, or any other&mdash;&#8203;entered Gwynedd
with a regular force; but if one <dfn>deal</dfn> was put to flight,
another, under Cadwgan himself, claims to have overcome
<a name="Yspwys" id="Yspwys"></a>the invaders at Yspwys.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_246" id="fnanchor_246"></a><a href="#footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></span>
The path was now open for
a march of the Britons to the south. Late in the year a
general attack was made on all the castles throughout
Ceredigion and Dyfed. Two only held out; Gerald of
Windsor successfully defended Pembroke; William the
son of Baldwin successfully defended Rhyd-y-gors.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_247" id="fnanchor_247"></a><a href="#footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Action of Cadwgan in Dyfed.</span>
But
the warfare of Cadwgan was waged in the interest of Gwynedd,
not in that of Dyfed. By a harsh, though possibly
prudent policy, he enforced a migration somewhat in the
style of an Eastern despot. The men and the cattle of
Ceredigion and Dyfed&mdash;&#8203;we must take so general a statement
with those deductions which the laws of possibility
imply&mdash;&#8203;were transported to the safer region, and south-western
Wales was made, so far as Cadwgan could
make it, a wilderness.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_248" id="fnanchor_248"></a><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Pembroke holds out.</span>
Gerald, in his castle among the
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
creeks, was left to lord it over whom he might find,
and to feed himself and his followers how he might,
in the wasted land. As far as we can see, Gwent,
Morganwg, and Brecheiniog, remained in the hands of
the conquerors. The rest of the British land, from the
isthmus of Gower to the furthest point of Mona, was
either free or a wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Question of a winter campaign.</span>
It is almost past belief that William Rufus could
have found time for a winter campaign against the
Welsh in the few weeks, or rather days, which passed
between his return from Normandy at the end of
December and his interview with Anselm at Gillingham
in the middle of January.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_249" id="fnanchor_249"></a><a href="#footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></span>
<span class="sni">December 28,1094-January, 1095.</span>
But there was plenty of
fighting in the course of the year in Wales and elsewhere.
The Britons seem to have kept their independence
in the newly liberated districts, while the
Norman conquerors of Glamorgan made a successful
attack on the intermediate lands which had not yet
been subdued. <span class="sni">Conquest of Kidwelly, Gower, and Caermarthen.</span>
“The French laid waste Gower, Kidwelly,
and the vale of Towy;” and we are further told that
those lands, as well as Dyfed and Ceredigion, remained
waste.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_250" id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span>
But if Normans laid waste, they did not simply
lay waste, like the Welsh. What they found it expedient
to lay waste for a season they meant to put in
order some day for their own advantage. This was
no doubt the time when William of London established
himself at Kidwelly, and made the first beginnings of
castle, church, borough, and haven.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_251" id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
It was now too that
the way was at least opened for the work of colonization
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
which made Gower a Teutonic land. <span class="sni">1099.</span>
According to an
authority to which we turn with a certain doubt, the
actual settlement dates from five years later. <span class="sni">Swansea Castle. The castles of Gower.</span>
Castles
were built, Abertawy or Swansea guarding its own bay
and the approach to the peninsula, Aberllwchr guarding
the sandy estuary between the peninsula and the opposite
coast to the north, Oystermouth, Penrice, Llanrhidian,
on points within the peninsula itself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_252" id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Alleged West-Saxon settlement of Gower.</span>
And in this
version the settlement is made, not by Flemings, according
to the common tradition, but by West-Saxons
brought across the channel from Somerset.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_253" id="fnanchor_253"></a><a href="#footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></span>
It is certain,
as has been already said, that there is not the same
historical evidence for Flemings in Gower which there
is for Flemings in Pembrokeshire. But it is perhaps
less important to fix the exact origin of each Teutonic
settlement along this coast than to insist on the fact that,
as compared with the native Cymry, any two branches
of the Nether-Dutch stock, whether Flemish or Saxon,
came to very much the same thing.</p>

<p>Along with this territorial advance on the part of
the invaders, we hear, from the same somewhat doubtful
quarter, of a movement among the invaders themselves
which turned to the advantage of the natives. It is
characteristic of the outwardly legal nature of the Norman
Conquest of England that it gave no opportunity
for a character not very rare in less regular invasions,
the invading chief who finds it to his interest to separate
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
himself from his own fellows and to place himself at
the head of those whom he has helped to subdue. In
the conquests both of Wales and of Ireland there was
room for such a part to be played, and the story sets
before us one of the Norman conquerors of Glamorgan
as playing it with some effect. <span class="sni">Pagan of Turberville joins the Welsh.</span>
The lord of Coyty,
Pagan of Turberville, married to a wife of the house
of Jestin, took the side of his wife’s countrymen, and, we
are told, went so far as to attack Cardiff on their behalf.
The result, it is said, was a confirmation of the ancient
laws of Wales on the part of the lord of Glamorgan.
This, it is added, led many to transfer their dwellings
from the disturbed parts of the country to the more
settled lands under his rule.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_254" id="fnanchor_254"></a><a href="#footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">North Wales keeps its independence.</span>
Meanwhile in the northern parts of Wales the Britons
still kept the independence that they had won by
the struggle of the last year. They had got the better
of the local powers on their own borders, and the
King, busied with the peaceful opposition of Anselm
and the armed opposition of Robert of Mowbray, had
little time to spare from councils and sieges within
his kingdom. <span class="sni">Autumn, 1095.</span>
At last, towards autumn, while the siege
of Bamburgh was going on, after he had himself turned
away from it, and left the <span class="title">Evil Neighbour</span> to do its work,
William heard a piece of news from the British border
which at once stirred him to action. One of the great
fortresses of the march had fallen. In vain had Earl
Roger made his nest on the rock to which he gave the
name of his own Norman home.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_255" id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></span>

<span class="sni">William’s invasion of Wales. Michaelmas, 1095.</span>
Soon after Michaelmas
he entered Wales at the head of his host. He
divided it into parties, and caused them to go thoroughly
through the land. <span class="sni">He reaches Snowdon. November 1.</span>
At last, by the feast of All-hallows,
the whole army met together by Snowdon. If merely
marching through a country could subdue it, William
Rufus had now done a good deal towards the conquest
of Gwynedd. But William Rufus was not Harold; the
master of continental chivalry could not bring himself
to copy Harold’s homely tactics. While the royal army
scoured the dales, the Welsh betook them to the moors
and mountains where no man might come at them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_258" id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></span>
Harold had found out the way to come at them; but
the Red King knew it not. <span class="sni">Ill-success of the campaign.</span>
All that he could do was to

<p><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
<span class="sni">1096.</span>
The next year saw the bloody Gemót at Salisbury;
it saw Europe pour forth its forces for the deliverance
of Eastern Christendom; it saw the Red King become
master of the Norman duchy. Among such cares, William
had no time, perhaps he felt no strong call, for another
Welsh campaign, either in winter or summer. But the
lords of the marches could not be thus idle; with them
the only choice was to invade or to be invaded. The year
seems to have begun with another gain on the part of the
Britons. <span class="sni">The Welsh gain Rhyd-y-gors. 1096.</span>
William son of Baldwin, who had kept the
castle of Rhyd-y-gors safe through all perils up to this
time, now died. His spirit did not abide in his garrison;
they left the castle empty, a prey to the enemy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_261" id="fnanchor_261"></a><a href="#footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></span>
The
spirit of the Britons, even in the lands which seemed
most thoroughly subdued, now rose. Within the bounds
of the present Glamorgan the favourable composition of
the last year seems to have kept men quiet; but the
lands to the east, parts of which had been so long under
English rule, were now encouraged to strike another blow
for independence. <span class="sni">Revolt of Gwent and Brecknock.</span>
The natives were in arms along the
whole line of the Usk; Brecheiniog, Gwent, and Gwenllwg,
the land between Usk and Wye and the land
between Usk and Rhymny, threw off, as their own
writers say, the yoke of the French.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_262" id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></span>
The marchers
had now to act in earnest. <span class="sni">English feeling towards the war.</span>
Our own Chronicler says
mournfully how “the head men that this land held
ofttimes sent the <dfn>fyrd</dfn> into Wales, and many men with
that sorely harassed, and man there sped not, but man-marring
and fee-spilling.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_263" id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span>
We see that the old duty
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
of every man to fight for the land when called on had
come to awaken some of the feelings which attach to a
conscription. Men were, we may believe, ready for a
campaign in Normandy or Maine, where plunder was
to be had, and where there was most likely still some
satisfaction felt in fighting against French-speaking
enemies, even under French-speaking captains. To drive
back Malcolm would come home to every man’s heart
as a national duty; to dispose of Malcolm’s crown under
the leadership of an English Ætheling might call up
long-forgotten feelings of national pride. But who could
be tempted by the prospect of a march to Snowdon, even
in the fairest weather? What interest had the men of
perhaps far-off English shires in rivetting the dominion
of a Norman lord on the men of Brecknock or Pembroke?
No doubt every Englishman was ready to drive back
the Briton from Shropshire and Herefordshire; but it
was an irksome and bootless work to go and attack
him in his own land, a land from which even conquerors
could draw so little gain. Even to win back Gwent,
the conquest of Harold, was an enterprise which would
lead mainly to man-marring and fee-spilling. <span class="sni">Vain attempt to recover Gwent.</span>
Into Gwent
however they were marched; but nothing was done; the
land was not subdued; the army was even attacked
on its retreat, and after great slaughter put to flight.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_264" id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span>
A second greater attempt came to nothing more. The
grandsons of Cadwgan, Gruffydd and Ivor, attacked this
army too on its return, and cut it also off at Aberllech.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_265" id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
The British chronicler here makes a comment which
fully explains the final issue of these wars. The Normans
or English, whichever we are to call the hosts of England
under the Red King, had thus for three years met with
nothing but defeat. Yet they had in truth won the
land. “The folk stayed in their homes, trusting fearlessly,
though the castles were yet whole, and the castlemen
in them.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_266" id="fnanchor_266"></a><a href="#footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Effects of the castle-building.</span>
The fortresses might be hemmed in for
a moment; but, as long as they stood whole with the
castlemen in them, the newly won freedom of the open
country was liable to be upset at any moment. In
Gwent and Brecheiniog at least the natives might for
the moment stay fearlessly in their homes; they might
at some favourable point surprise and cut to pieces the
armies that were sent against them; they might withdraw
to moors and mountains when the invading force was
too strong for them; but, as long as the castles stood
firm, the real grasp of the stranger on the land was
not loosened. How long a castle could stand out we
see by the example of this very year’s campaign. <span class="sni">Pembroke castle holds out.</span>
All
the castles of Dyfed and Ceredigion had been destroyed
two years before, save Pembroke and Rhyd-y-gors; and
Rhyd-y-gors was now in the hands of the Britons. Pembroke,
the castle of earth and wood, the outpost cut off
from all help, still stood through the whole of these two
years, the one representative of Norman dominion in the
whole region of which it had become the head. No wonder
that the Britons, victorious everywhere else, resolved on
one great attack on this still unconquered stronghold of the
enemy. <span class="sni">The Welsh attack Pembroke. 1096.</span>
A host led by several chieftains of the house of
Cadwgan, Uhtred son of Edwin,--one whom we should
rather have looked for in Northumberland,--and Howel
son of Goronwy, set forth and fought against Pembroke.
Gerald of Windsor was hard pressed. One night, fifteen
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">109</span>
of his knights, despairing of resistance, made their
escape from the castle in a boat. <span class="sni">Resistance of Gerald of Windsor.</span>
Their esquires were
more faithful, and Gerald at once gave them the arms

<span class="sni">His devices.</span>
We read too
how Gerald, to hide his real plight from the enemy,
betook himself to some of those simple devices of which
we hear in so many times and places. He had four
swine in the castle; he cut them in pieces, and threw
them over to the besiegers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_268" id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span>
The next day he wrote
or caused letters to be written sealed with his seal, saying
that there was no need to trouble Earl Arnulf&mdash;&#8203;he is
made to bear the title&mdash;&#8203;for any help for four months
to come. <span class="sni">His dealings with Bishop Wilfrith.</span>
These letters he took care should be found

They
were read out in the Welsh army. The Britons, we are

away.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_270" id="fnanchor_270"></a><a href="#footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></span>
They claim to have marched away without loss,
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">110</span>
with much booty, especially with all the cattle belonging
to the castle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_271" id="fnanchor_271"></a><a href="#footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Offensive action of Gerald. 1097.</span>
But the castle was not taken; it stood

David’s.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_272" id="fnanchor_272"></a><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span>
Friendship for the Bishop perhaps kept him
from harrying the holy soil of Dewisland itself.</p>

<p>This year, the King, as he had done two years before,
deemed the affairs of Wales to call for his own presence,
and for a greater effort on his part than ever. He had
come back from taking possession of the mortgaged land
of Normandy; <span class="sni">Easter, 1097.</span>
he had held the Easter Assembly at
Windsor somewhat after the regular time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_273" id="fnanchor_273"></a><a href="#footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></span>
At that
Assembly Welsh affairs must have formed a subject of
discussion, as the King presently set out for Wales with
a great host. This was the time when the knights sent
by the Archbishop were deemed so unfit for their duty.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_274" id="fnanchor_274"></a><a href="#footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></span>
<span class="sni">William’s second Welsh campaign.</span>

<span class="sni">Seeming conquest.</span>
and he clearly

So he deemed when he came back to hold the Whitsun

They had once bowed <em>to</em> him; now they bowed

formally <em>defied</em> him in the strict feudal sense; certainly
they defied him in the more general sense which that
word has now come to bear. And now, for the first
time in these wars, the English Chronicler gives us the
name of a Welsh leader, a name which from British
sources has long been familiar to us. <span class="sni">Cadwgan.</span>
“They chose them

the prince whom
it needed all the strength and all the arts of Harold
to overthrow, was still famous even among Englishmen.
The nephew of Gruffydd had this time too to dread no
such tactics as had worn down his uncle on his own
soil. <span class="sni">William’s third campaign. June-August, 1097.</span>

<span class="sni">He determines to build castles. October, 1097.</span>
As invasions by mounted knights led to nothing
but losing both the knights and their horses, he would
build castles on the borders. This Harold, who knew so
much better than William Rufus how to carry on a Welsh
campaign, had not done. But then the objects of Harold
and the objects of William Rufus were not the same.</p>

<p>We should have been well pleased to know what was
the immediate result of the resolve for the building of
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
the border-castles. What were the fortresses which were
built, as surely some must have been built, in obedience
to it? This is the last entry which connects Rufus
personally with Welsh affairs. But we can hardly help
connecting this resolve with the building, a little time
later, of several fortresses in the lands threatened by the
Welsh, specially of one, the greatest of them all. <span class="sni">Action of Robert of Bellême. 1098&ndash;1102.</span>
In
the next year one part of the British land becomes the
scene of a series of events of far-reaching interest and
importance, but also of a local interest quite as great in
its own way. We shall then see that, if the Red King
did not do much in the way of building border-castles
himself, much was done by others, of course with his
approval, most likely by his order. Our next year’s
tale brings Robert of Bellême to the Welsh border,
and, where he was lord, castle-building went on with
all vigour.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Affairs of Scotland.</span>
But before we enter on a branch of our story which
touches all parts of the British islands, and many lands
beyond the British islands, it may be well to take up
the thread of our Scottish narrative at a point where the
affairs of Scotland and those of Wales seem again to be
brought into some measure of connexion. The year
which saw that wise resolution of the Red King with
regard to the Welsh castles, a resolution which really
meant the final union of Wales with the English realm,
saw also the end of those revolutions whose final result
was, not the union of Scotland with the English realm&mdash;&#8203;that
was not to come about till long after, and by other
means&mdash;&#8203;but the extension of English influence within
the kingdom of Scotland till it might be looked on as in
truth a second English realm.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Decree for action in Scotland. August, 1097.</span>
It must have been at one of the later assemblies of
the year which we have now reached, most likely at the
August gathering,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_288" id="fnanchor_288"></a><a href="#footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></span>
that the resolution was taken for
vigorous action in Scotland. The King himself had
had enough of Welsh warfare; he must have been
already looking forward to those French and Cenomannian
campaigns which form the main feature of the
next year; he was in the middle of his final dispute
with Anselm. But William Rufus seems always to have
been well pleased to set others in motion, even on enterprises
in which he did not share himself. <span class="sni">Designs of the Ætheling Eadgar.</span>
So he gladly
hearkened to the proposals of the Ætheling Eadgar for
an expedition into Scotland. Its object was to overthrow
the usurper Donald, as the chosen of Dunfermline was
deemed at Winchester, to restore the line of Malcolm
and Margaret, and to bring the Scottish kingdom once
more into its due obedience to the over-lord in England.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Relations between Eadgar and the King.</span>
Our last certain notice of Eadgar sets him before us as
enjoying the fullest confidence on the part of the reigning
King, as sent by him on the important errand of negotiating
with Malcolm and bringing him to William’s
court at Gloucester.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_289" id="fnanchor_289"></a><a href="#footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Story of Godwine and Ordgar.</span>
One hardly knows what to make
of the tale which describes him as awakening a certain
amount of suspicion in the King’s mind later in the
same year;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_290" id="fnanchor_290"></a><a href="#footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></span>
but that, either before or after this time, he
was in some such danger appears from another tale in
the details of which there may or may not be a legendary
element, but which undoubtedly brings before us real
persons and a real state of things. To this tale I have
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pageno">115</span>
already referred elsewhere, as having that kind of interest
which belongs to every story in which we see any one
of those who are recorded in the Great Survey as mere
names stand forth as a living man, playing his part in
the world of living men. However obscure the man,
however small his deeds, there is always an interest in
finding any part of the dry bones of Domesday clothed
with flesh and blood. And the interest becomes higher
when the man thus called forth out of darkness is a man
of native English birth, and the father of one whom England
may well be glad to reckon among her worthies.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_291" id="fnanchor_291"></a><a href="#footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Eadgar accused by Ordgar.</span>
The story runs then that a knight of English birth,
Ordgar by name, seeking favour with the King, brought a
charge against the English Ætheling. He told William
that Eadgar, trusting to his own descent from ancient
kings, was seeking to deprive the reigning king of his
crown. William hearkened to the accuser, and some
grievous doom&mdash;&#8203;would it have been the doom of William
of Eu?--was in store for Eadgar, if his guilt&mdash;&#8203;his ambition
or patriotism&mdash;&#8203;could be proved. <span class="sni">The ordeal and the battle.</span>
But how was the
charge to be proved or disproved? By Old-English law the
appeal to the judgement of God in doubtful cases was by
the ordeal; and, as between Englishman and Englishman,
this rule had not been changed by the laws of the Conqueror.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_292" id="fnanchor_292"></a><a href="#footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></span>
But we can well believe that Englishmen who
were admitted to a place in the Red King’s court had
largely put on the ideas and feelings of Normans. They
would doubtless look down on the ancient practice of
their fathers, and they would be more inclined to follow
the fashion of their Norman companions in better liking
the more chivalrous test of the wager of battle. It seems
in the present story to be taken for granted that the
trial will be by wager of battle. But who will do battle
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">116</span>
for Eadgar, when the royal favour is so clearly shown
on behalf of Eadgar’s accuser? The Ætheling was sad at
heart, forsaken, as it seemed, of all men. <span class="sni">Godwine volunteers to fight for Eadgar.</span>
But at last
one stepped forward who was ready to dare the risk on
behalf of a man to whom he was bound by a double
tie. As an Englishman he was stirred to come to
the help of the descendant of the ancient kings, and he
was further bound to Eadgar by the special tie which
binds a man to his lord. He was a knight of noble
English descent, known as Godwine of Winchester.
<span class="sni">Notices of him in Domesday.</span>
We know him in Domesday as a tenant of the
Ætheling for lands in Hertfordshire, and the Survey
further suggests that he may have had a private grudge
against the opposite champion. There were lands in
Oxfordshire which were held by an Ordgar, and which
had been held by a Godwine. <span class="sni">Duel of Godwine and Ordgar.</span>
The matter is to be
decided by the hand-to-hand fight of the two English
knights. For they so far cleave to the customs of their
fathers that they fight on foot and deal handstrokes
with their swords. Ordgar comes forth in splendid
armour, surrounded by a crowd of courtiers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_293" id="fnanchor_293"></a><a href="#footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></span>
Godwine
has nothing to trust to but his sword and his good
cause. But there was at least no attempt made to
hinder a fair fight&mdash;&#8203;so to do would have been altogether
foreign to the spirit of the chivalrous king. The herald
and the umpire do their duty;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_294" id="fnanchor_294"></a><a href="#footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></span>
the knights take their
oath to forbear the use of all weapons but those which
were needed in the knightly duel. A long and hard fight
follows, the ups and downs of which are described with
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">117</span>
Homeric minuteness. <span class="sni">Victory of Godwine, and acquittal of Eadgar.</span>
Ordgar at last, sorely wounded, is
pressed to the ground, with the foot of the victorious Godwine
upon him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_295" id="fnanchor_295"></a><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span>
As a last resource, he strives, but in
vain, to stab Godwine with a knife which, in breach of his
oath, he had treacherously hidden in his boot.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_296" id="fnanchor_296"></a><a href="#footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></span>
Godwine
snatches the knife from him; Ordgar confesses the falsehood
of his charge, and presently dies of his wounds.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_297" id="fnanchor_297"></a><a href="#footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></span>
Godwine now becomes an object of universal honour,
and receives from the King the lands of the slain Ordgar,
while Eadgar rises higher than ever in the King’s
favour.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Estimate of the story.</span>
I see no reason to doubt the main outline of this
story, which rests on the evidence of undesigned coincidences.
Men of no special renown, about whom
there was no temptation to invent fables, are made to
act in a way which exactly agrees with what we know
from the surest of witnesses to have been their real
position. Without pledging ourselves to the details of
the combat, which have a slightly legendary sound, we
may surely believe that we have here the record of a
real wager of battle, like those which happened at no
great distance of time in the cases of William of Eu and
Arnulf of Hesdin. <span class="sni">Its general truth. Englishmen under Rufus.</span>
We may surely believe that Eadgar
was wrongfully accused, and that Godwine cleared his
lord in the duel. We see then that in the Red King’s
day there was nothing to hinder men of Old-English
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pageno">118</span>
birth, exceptionally lucky men doubtless, from holding
an honourable rank and a high place in royal favour.
But we learn also, as we might expect to find, that such
Englishmen found that it suited their purposes to adopt
Norman fashions. <span class="sni">Robert son of Godwine.</span>
Of Godwine we hear no more; but
his son, as I have noticed elsewhere, bears, according to a
very common rule, the Norman name of Robert.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_298" id="fnanchor_298"></a><a href="#footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></span>
Had
we chanced to hear of him without hearing the name
of his father, we might not have known that the hero
and martyr was a man of our own blood.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">The Eadgars march to Scotland. September, 1097.</span>
We now follow the Ætheling to a warfare in which
Robert the son of Godwine is his companion. Eadgar set
out about Michaelmas to place his nephew and namesake
on the Scottish throne. He had a bright comet
and a shower of falling stars to light him on his
way.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_299" id="fnanchor_299"></a><a href="#footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></span>
But Donald was hardly of importance enough for
the heavenly powers to foretell his fall; <span class="sni">The comet.</span>
the shining
and departure of the comet was rather understood to
mark the approaching day when Anselm, the light of
England, turned away from our land and left darkness
behind him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_300" id="fnanchor_300"></a><a href="#footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span>
The force of the Ætheling seems
to have been of much the same kind as the force which
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">119</span>
Duncan had led on the same errand three years before.
He went with the King’s approval and support, but
certainly without the King’s personal help, perhaps
without any part of the royal army.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_301" id="fnanchor_301"></a><a href="#footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></span>
That army, as
we have lately seen, was just then coming together for
another errand.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_302" id="fnanchor_302"></a><a href="#footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Vision of the younger Eadgar.</span>
The host then marched northward. On the way, we
are told, the younger Eadgar was honoured by a vision
of Saint Cuthberht, who bade him take his banner from
the abbey at Durham&mdash;&#8203;the abbey now without a bishop&mdash;&#8203;and
he should have victory in the battle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_303" id="fnanchor_303"></a><a href="#footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></span>
The banner
was borne before the army; the fight in which it was
unfurled was long and hard; but the valour of the men
who fought under its folds was not to be withstood.
<span class="sni">Exploits of Robert son of Godwine.</span>
Without binding ourselves to details which may well
be legendary, we may believe that Robert son of Godwine
was foremost in the fight, and that the victory in which
<span class="sni">Defeat and blinding of Donald.</span>
Donald was the second time overthrown was largely
owing to his personal prowess.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_304" id="fnanchor_304"></a><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span>

His valiant comrade abode for a while in the

<p><span class="sni">Eadgar and Robert go to the Crusade.</span>
Robert the son of Godwine was presently called to
a nobler work. His lord the Ætheling went to the Holy
War. Eadgar was not one of those who marched first of
all with the two Roberts of Normandy and Flanders.
He was one of that second party who set forth about
the time of the siege of Antioch, <span class="sni">1099.</span>

Robert the
son of Godwine, if he stayed in Britain long enough to
have any dealings with Flambard in his character of
Bishop of Durham, must have set out later still. He
could have had no share in the leaguer of Nikaia or
of Antioch; most likely he had no share in the rescue
of the Holy City. <span class="sni">Robert in Palestine.</span>
He could hardly have reached
Syria till Jerusalem was again a Christian kingdom

calling to Dame Isabel in the hall of Conches.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_316" id="fnanchor_316"></a><a href="#footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></span>

Such men she

the earlier Robert our century has seen the true successors

in the Englishman who sells his soul and his sword to
keep down the yoke of the barbarian on the necks of his

With the accession of Eadgar to the Scottish crown

The influence of the reign of Eadgar told wholly in
favour of the process by which Scotland was becoming an
English kingdom. The reign of Alexander told perhaps
less directly in favour of things specially English,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_328" id="fnanchor_328"></a><a href="#footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></span>
but it
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
worked strongly towards the more general object of
bringing Scotland into the common circle of western
Christendom. <span class="sni">Effects of the reign of David. 1124&ndash;1153.</span>
The succession of David reunited the
Scottish dominions, and his vigorous rule of twenty-nine
years brought to perfection all that his parents had begun.
That famous prince was bound to England by every tie of
descent, habit, and affinity. <span class="sni">His English position;</span>
Brother of her Queen, uncle of
her Imperial Lady,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_329" id="fnanchor_329"></a><a href="#footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></span>
David was an English earl in a stricter
sense than any king of Scots who had gone before him.
<span class="sni">his earldoms.</span>
He was not only Earl of Lothian, which was becoming fast
incorporated with Scotland&mdash;&#8203;or more truly was fast incorporating
Scotland with itself&mdash;&#8203;nor yet only of Northumberland
and Cumberland, with which the same process
might easily have been carried out.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_330" id="fnanchor_330"></a><a href="#footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></span>
He was Earl also of
distant and isolated Huntingdon, an earldom which could
not be held except on the same terms as its fellows of
Leicester or Warwick. <span class="sni">English influence in Scotland.</span>
Under David, the great reformer,
the great civilizer, but at the same time the king who
made the earlier life of Scotland a thing of the past, all
that was English, all that was Norman, was welcomed in
the land which was now truly a northern England. <span class="sni">His invasion of England.</span>
If
David, like his father, appeared as an invader of England,
if, in so doing, he made England feel that he had subjects
who were still far from being either English or Norman,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_331" id="fnanchor_331"></a><a href="#footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></span>
he did so only as a benevolent mediator in the affairs of
England, as the champion of the claims of one of his nieces
against the claims of the other. <span class="sni">The Scottish kings of the second series.</span>
With the three sons of
Malcolm and Margaret begins the line of those whom we
may call the second series of Scottish kings, those who
still came in the direct line of old Scottish royalty, but
under whom Scotland was a disciple of England, and on
the whole friendly to England. They stand distinguished
alike from the purely Celtic kings who went before them,
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
and from the kings, Norman or English as we may
choose to call them by natural descent, who were politically
more hostile to England than the old Malcolms and
Kenneths. Eadgar and Alexander died childless; the
later kings were all of the stock of David. <span class="sni">The English or Norman candidates for the Scottish crown.</span>
Of that
stock&mdash;&#8203;and thereby of the stock of Waltheof and Siward
and their forefathers of whatever species&mdash;&#8203;came
that motley group who in after days wrangled for David’s
crown. Bruce, Balliol, Hastings, Comyn, all came by female
descent of the line of David and Matilda. In every
other aspect all of them were simply English nobles of
the time. It is an odd destiny by which, according as
they supported or withstood the rights of their own
prince over the kingdom which they claimed, some of
them have won the name of Scottish traitors and others
the name of Scottish patriots.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§ 5. <span class="title">The Expedition of Magnus.</span> 1098.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Events of the year 1098.</span>
The events of the year which followed the last revolution
in Scotland amount to a general stirring of all the
lands which could in ordinary times have any influence
on the affairs of England. <span class="sni">Their wide geographical range.</span>
We shall see in the next
chapter that it was the busiest of times in the Gaulish
mainland, where the designs of Rufus, now undisputed
master of Normandy, spread far beyond anything
that had been dreamed of by any earlier holder of the
Norman duchy. For warfare or for alliance, the range
of our story during this most stirring year stretches from
the fiords of Norway to the gorges of the Pyrenees. In
the present section we have to look to the northern side
of this tangled drama, and to take the specially British
aspect of it as our centre. A mighty undertaking, which
moved the whole of north-western Europe, which touched
England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and the smaller islands
which lie between and around them, comes home to us
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
mainly as it touches that one among those islands which
might almost pass for a part of the mainland of southern
Britain. <span class="sni">Magnus of Norway.</span>
The great warfare of Magnus of Norway mainly
concerns our story so far as it almost casually became a
part of warfare in Wales, and specially of warfare in
Anglesey. <span class="sni">Anglesey the centre of the story.</span>
And, as regards England itself, the most
important aspect of a movement which stirred every
northern land was that it indirectly lifted one man who
was already great beyond endurance in Normandy and
its border lands into a place of greatness even less endurable
in England and its border lands. <span class="sni">The Earls of Shrewsbury.</span>
We have to
tell a tale spreading over many lands and seas, a tale full
of personal pictures and personal exploits. To Englishmen
of the last years of the eleventh century and the
first years of the twelfth, its most practical aspect was
that it took away Earl Hugh of Shrewsbury and set
his brother Robert in his place.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The winter of 1097.</span>
We must now look back to the moment, late in the
last year, when the Welsh seemed to have completely
won back their freedom, except in Glamorgan and at
the single point covered by the unconquered fortress of
Pembroke.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_332" id="fnanchor_332"></a><a href="#footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></span>
It is startling to find in our next notice
that the Britons, without any mention of any fresh loss,
are beginning to stand on the defensive, and to seek
out as it were a last shelter. <span class="sni">The war of Anglesey. 1098.</span>
The war is now shifted
to a quarter of which we have hitherto heard less
than of some other parts of Wales, and it becomes
connected with movements in other parts of the world
which carry us back a generation. The island off the
north-west corner of Wales, that Mona or Mevania to
which half-forgotten English conquests had given the
name of Anglesey,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_333" id="fnanchor_333"></a><a href="#footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></span>
became now, as in the days of
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
Roman invasion, the chief&mdash;&#8203;at the time it may have
seemed the last&mdash;&#8203;stronghold of British resistance. The
island, parted from the British mainland by the narrow
strait&mdash;&#8203;the Hellespont&mdash;&#8203;of Menai, lying within sight of
the fortress of Robert of Rhuddlan at Dwyganwy, seems
for the last four years to have been left untouched by
any Norman invader. <span class="sni">Schemes of Cadwgan and Gruffydd.</span>
But now we read that the princes
of Gwynedd, Cadwgan son of Bleddyn, their worthiest
elder, and Gruffydd the slayer of Robert, with the
general assent of the Britons of the north, agree in
council, as one of their own chroniclers puts it, to save
Mona.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_334" id="fnanchor_334"></a><a href="#footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></span>
This form of words seems to imply less trust in
their own resources than we might have looked for in
the elders of the Britons after their late successes. If
Mona needed to be saved, one would think that they
must already have found that there was little real
chance of saving Gwynedd or Dyfed. And the way by
which they sought to save Mona was hardly a wise one,
though it was one which might have been defended by
many precedents. <span class="sni">The Welsh take wikings from Ireland into pay.</span>
Just as Gruffydd had done ten
years before, they took into their pay a fleet of pirates
from Ireland, wikings doubtless from the Scandinavian
settlements, whom one Welsh writer, perhaps more from
habit than as meaning his words to be taken in their
full force, speaks of as heathens.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_335" id="fnanchor_335"></a><a href="#footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></span>
With these allies,
and with the main body of their own forces, the British
leaders withdrew into Anglesey.</p>

<p><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
<span class="sni">The two Earls Hugh, of Chester and Shrewsbury.</span>
The news of this alliance was thought serious enough
to call for vigorous action on the part of the two earls
of the border. Both now bore the same name. Hugh
of Avranches still ruled at Chester&mdash;&#8203;we last heard of
him as counselling the cruel punishment of William of
Eu; Hugh of Montgomery was drawing near to the
end of his short dominion over Shropshire. The
Scandinavian writers couple the two Hughs together,
and they distinguish the elder by the well-earned surname
of Hugh the Fat, and the younger by that of
Hugh the Proud.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_336" id="fnanchor_336"></a><a href="#footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></span>
They gathered their forces, Norman
and English, and crossed over to Anglesey. The
first step towards the occupation of the island was
the usual Norman means, the building of a castle. In
this case they had not to build for the first time, but
to build up afresh what the Welsh had destroyed in
the moment of victory. It will be remembered that,
four years before, the Britons in their great revolt had
won back Anglesey and broken down the castle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_337" id="fnanchor_337"></a><a href="#footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Rebuilding of the castle of Aberlleiniog.</span>
There
seems no reason to doubt that the site of the old work
was the site of the new, and that that site marks at once
the landing-place of the two earls and the scene of the
fall of one of them. It lies on the eastern side of the
island, quite free from the strait, and nearly due west
from the scene of the Marquess Robert’s death at
Dwyganwy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_338" id="fnanchor_338"></a><a href="#footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></span>
It lies about half way between the priory
of Penmon&mdash;&#8203;the head of Mona&mdash;&#8203;parts of whose simple
and venerable church must be nearly contemporary
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
with our times,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_339" id="fnanchor_339"></a><a href="#footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></span>
and the great fortress of later days at
Beaumaris, the head of the island shire. A small
expanse of flat and marshy ground marks the spot where
the small stream of Lleiniog, mere brook as it is, makes
its independent way into the sea. <span class="sni">Traces of the castle.</span>
On its left bank
the careful enquirer will find, what he will certainly not
see at a glance, a castle-mound with its ditches, now,
after the usual senseless and provoking fashion, masked
with trees. But he who makes his way within will find,
not only the mound, but the square tower crowning
it, though he will hardly deem this last to be a work
of the two earls. In front of the castle, immediately
above the sea, a slight natural height seems to have been
improved by art into a smaller mound. The earthworks
at least the earls doubtless found ready to their hand,
whether they had been thrown up in the earlier invasion
of the island, or whether the invaders had then taken
advantage of mounds thrown up by men of earlier times.
Here we have beyond doubt the remains of the castle
of Aberlleiniog, the castle which Hugh the Fat and Hugh
the Proud designed to hold Anglesey in check.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_340" id="fnanchor_340"></a><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span>
But it
was not only to the craft of the engineer that the two
Hughs trusted. <span class="sni">The earls bribe the wikings.</span>
The earls of the Red King’s day had
learned to practise the special arts of their master. The
wikings were bribed with the gold of England to betray
the cause of their British allies, and they gave the earls
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>
valuable help in making good their entrance into
Anglesey.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_341" id="fnanchor_341"></a><a href="#footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Cadwgan and Gruffydd flee to Ireland.</span>
It was in strange contrast with the vigour which for
several years had been shown by the Welsh leaders,
and with the success which had commonly waited on
their arms, but quite in harmony with their last action
of all, when Cadwgan and Gruffydd, seeing the turn
which things had taken, threw up the common cause
altogether and fled to Ireland to secure their own safety.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_342" id="fnanchor_342"></a><a href="#footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></span>
Anglesey was now left to the mercy of the two earls.
The character for gentleness which Hugh of Shrewsbury
bears, and which he may have deserved in the government
of his own earldom, brought no lessening of
suffering to British enemies. Wherever the two Hughs
marched, men were slaughtered, or were, in modern eyes
at least, worse than slaughtered. <span class="sni">Cruel treatment of the Welsh captives.</span>
They were blinded,
deprived of hands and feet, or made to undergo the other
mutilations usual at the time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_343" id="fnanchor_343"></a><a href="#footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></span>
In some cases at least
the earls trampled on every privilege of holy places and
holy persons. <span class="sni">Desecration of the church of Saint Tyfrydog.</span>
It may be deemed a lesser matter that
one of them caused his hounds to pass a night in the
church of Saint Tyfrydog, and found them all mad in
the morning.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_344" id="fnanchor_344"></a><a href="#footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></span>
The privileges of the Church could not
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>
shelter even her human and priestly servants. One
special victim was an aged priest, who is said to have
taken a leading part in the war by the advice which
he gave to the Welsh. <span class="sni">Mutilation of Cenred.</span>
His name Cenred bespeaks
English birth; the form of the name is Mercian; if he
had passed from the earldom of either Hugh to the side
of the Welsh, he would naturally be looked on as a
traitor, and his treason would explain the excessive
harshness with which he was treated. The old man was
dragged out of a church; besides more shameful suffering,
one eye was torn out, and his tongue was also cut out.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_345" id="fnanchor_345"></a><a href="#footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></span>
This last form of mutilation seems to have been confined
to himself, and it may have been meant as specially
befitting one who had used that dangerous member to
give counsel to the enemy. <span class="sni">Restoration of his speech.</span>
And now, according to our
story, happened one of those signs and wonders which were
at the time naturally deemed miraculous, but for which
modern times have supplied, if not an explanation, at
least a parallel. Cenred fared like the victims of Gelimer
of old, like the victims of Djezzar in modern times; three
days after the loss of his tongue, his speech came back
to him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_346" id="fnanchor_346"></a><a href="#footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></span>
Four days later again, so men deemed at Worcester,
came vengeance on one at least of the two earls
for the cruel deed which they had wrought on him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_347" id="fnanchor_347"></a><a href="#footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Expedition of Magnus Barefoot.</span>
If wikings from Ireland had betrayed the cause of the
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
Britons, a far mightier wiking was now afloat, if not to
give help to the Britons, at least to act as a minister of
wrath upon their enemies. The tale of Stamfordbridge
seems to come over again on the western, instead of the
eastern, side of the British islands. For a grandson of
Harold Hardrada shows himself at the head of a power
almost equalling that of his grandfather; he brings
a grandson of Godwine in his train, he overcomes
two Mercian earls, and finds his own doom, not indeed
in Yorkshire, but in Ireland. But the enterprise which
recalls so many points in the enterprise of two-and-thirty
years earlier was not in any strict sense an invasion
of England. <span class="sni">Character of his reign. 1093&ndash;1103.</span>
Magnus, the son of that peaceful Olaf
of whom we have heard in the Conqueror’s day,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_348" id="fnanchor_348"></a><a href="#footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></span>
now
reigned in Norway in the spirit of his grandfather rather
than in that of his father. <span class="sni">His surnames.</span>
He bore various surnames, as
the Tall and the Lover-of-Strife; but his name has gone
down in history with the special epithet of Magnus Barefoot&mdash;&#8203;more
strictly it would seem Bare-leg&mdash;&#8203;a name
which is said to have been given to him as one of the
results of the enterprise of which we have now to speak.
<span class="sni">1093&ndash;1098.</span>
After showing himself for five years as a mighty warrior
in his own peninsula, Magnus set forth to bring more
western lands under his obedience. <span class="sni">He professes friendship for England.</span>
Against England
he professed to have no designs, and the little that we
casually hear of him in connexion with England seems
to imply friendly relations. His son Sigurd, afterwards
famous as the Crusader, was the child of an English captive.
Her name of Thora witnesses to her Scandinavian
descent;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_349" id="fnanchor_349"></a><a href="#footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></span>
but her captivity could not have been the work
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
of the arms of Magnus. <span class="sni">His treasure at Lincoln.</span>
Either now or at some later time,
he entrusted a great treasure, twenty thousand pounds
of silver, to the keeping of a rich citizen of Lincoln,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_350" id="fnanchor_350"></a><a href="#footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></span>
a
sign of the high place which was still held by the city
of the Danish Lawmen, and of the connexion which its
citizens still kept up with the kingdoms of the North.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_351" id="fnanchor_351"></a><a href="#footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Harold son of Harold in his fleet.</span>
But, peaceful as might be the professions of Magnus
toward England, there was one in his fleet whose presence
could not fail to call up thoughts of deeds which had been
done, or which might again be done, on English ground.
<a name="line134_11" id="line134_11"></a>We learn from one of the most casual of notices that Magnus
had with him a man who, if the course of things had
gone otherwise a generation earlier, might then himself
have been the wearer of the English crown, who would at
least have stood nearer to it than either the Ætheling of
the blood of Cerdic or the Ætheling of the blood of Rolf.
It could hardly have been without an object that the
grandson of Harold the son of Sigurd brought with him
the son of Harold the son of Godwine. Strange indeed was
the fate of the twin sons of the doubly widowed Ealdgyth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_352" id="fnanchor_352"></a><a href="#footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></span>
Each flashes across our sight for a moment, and only for a
moment. <a name="line134_7" id="line134_7"></a>Ulf we have seen the prisoner of the Conqueror;
we have seen him sent forth by the Conqueror’s son to go
in freedom and honour, but to go we know not whither.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_353" id="fnanchor_353"></a><a href="#footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></span>
And now, for once in the course of a life which must have
been a chequered one, we hear the name of his brother.
Some ship in the fleet of Magnus bore, as its guest or as
its captain, Harold the son of Harold King of the English.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_354" id="fnanchor_354"></a><a href="#footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></span>
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
Whence he came, whither he went, before and after
that one voyage to the shores of Britain, we know not.
Grandson of Godwine, grandson of Ælfgar, begotten, but
not born, to the kingship of England, the child of the
widow did not see the light in the City of the Legions
till his father had found his cairn upon the rocks of
Hastings, perhaps his tomb before the altar at Waltham.
What friendly hand saved him, when his brother came
into the Conqueror’s power, we know not, any more than
we know the later fortunes of his mother. But now the
younger Harold came, the guest of one whose grandfather
had felt the might, as his father had felt the mild-heartedness,
of the elder Harold.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_355" id="fnanchor_355"></a><a href="#footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></span>
His voyage brought
him not near to either the most glorious or the most
mournful memories of his father. The fleet of Magnus
kept aloof alike from the shores of Yorkshire and from
the shores of Sussex. But the younger Harold came to
look for a moment on the land where his mother had
dwelled as a queen, and which his father had filled with
the trophies of his conquest.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_356" id="fnanchor_356"></a><a href="#footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></span>
He came to see the British
shores lined with English warriors, but to see them under
the rule of the Norman leaders who had divided between
them so great a part of the earldom of his mother’s house,
and the elder of whom reigned as all but a king in the
city of his own birth. Son and nephew of the three who
died on Senlac, he saw from the Norwegian ship the fall
of the son of the man who led the charge which first
broke down the English palisade upon that hill of doom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_357" id="fnanchor_357"></a><a href="#footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></span>
And then, his name once spoken, he passes away into
utter darkness. Of Ulf, the knight of the Norman duke,
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
of Harold the comrade of the Norwegian king, we have
no tale to tell save that they were such.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Magnus’ designs on Ireland.</span>
One version of our tale speaks of Ireland as the main
object of the expedition of Magnus, as it certainly was
the object of his last expedition some years later. <span class="sni">His alleged Irish marriage.</span>
He
had, it is said, married the daughter of an Irish king, but
his father-in-law had failed to carry out the marriage-contract.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_358" id="fnanchor_358"></a><a href="#footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></span>
There is nothing of this in the Norwegian
account, which speaks only of a later marriage between
Sigurd son of Magnus <span class="sni">Irish marriage of his son Sigurd.</span>
and a daughter of King Murtagh.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_359" id="fnanchor_359"></a><a href="#footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></span>
But it seems clear from a comparison of the various
accounts that Magnus did, at some stage of the present
voyage, make an attack on Ireland; it seems reasonable
therefore to suppose that Irish enterprise formed part of
his scheme from the beginning.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_360" id="fnanchor_360"></a><a href="#footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His voyage among the islands.</span>
Our own narrative is
more concerned with his course along the shores of our
own island, in which however he seems to have barely
touched Britain itself, in either its Scottish or its English
regions. His exploits lay among the smaller islands of
the British seas, most of which had at that moment more
to do with Ireland than with either England or Scotland.
It is not easy to call up from among many conflicting
statements an exact picture of the state of things at the
time. <span class="sni">Dominion of Godred Cronan.</span>
In the interval between the expedition of Harold
Hardrada and the expedition of his grandson, Godred
the son of Harold, surnamed <a name="Crouan" id="Crouan"></a>Cronan, he whom we have
heard of at Stamford bridge,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_361" id="fnanchor_361"></a><a href="#footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></span>
<span class="sni">1075&ndash;1091.</span>
had raised up a considerable
dominion of which Man was the centre. <span class="sni">1078.</span>
He ruled
over Dublin and the greater part of Leinster, and over
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
the Sudereys or Hebrides; and, if the chronicle of his

singular treaty, the object of which must have been to
hinder Scotland from becoming a naval power.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_362" id="fnanchor_362"></a><a href="#footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></span>
We may
guess that some of the piratical adventurers of whom we
have heard once or twice in our Welsh notices, as for
instance in the story of Robert of Rhuddlan and again
in the tale which we have just told, were in truth subjects
of Godred. But the dominion of Godred was one
of those powers which seem as it were casually founded,
and which seldom long outlive the reign of their founder.
His Irish dominion did not last even so long as his own
life. <span class="sni">Godred driven out of Dublin. 1094.</span>
After seventeen years of possession, he was driven
out of Dublin by Murtagh, and in the next year he died,
leaving three sons, Lagman, Harold, and Olaf, of whom
Lagman succeeded to his island dominion. <span class="sni">His death.</span>
<span class="sni">1095.</span>
<span class="sni">His sons, Lagman and Harold.</span>
In the Manx
version of the tale, Lagman, disturbed by a rebellion of
his brother Harold, took a frightful revenge by inflicting
on him the usual cruel mutilations. Then, smitten
with remorse, he made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and
died there.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_363" id="fnanchor_363"></a><a href="#footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></span>
The chief men of the Sudereys, hearing of
his death, asked King Murtagh for a ruler during the
minority of Olaf. <span class="sni">Donald sent by Murtagh to the Sudereys.</span>
This would almost look as if Murtagh
had not only driven Godred out of Ireland, but had established
some kind of supremacy over Man itself. But the
ruler sent, Donald by name, proved a tyrant, and was
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
driven out.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_364" id="fnanchor_364"></a><a href="#footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Ingemund sent by Magnus.</span>
Then we are told that Magnus himself sent
one Ingemund to take the crown of the Isles, that the
chief men came together in Lewis to make him king but
that his outrages on their wives and daughters made
them change their purpose. Instead of crowning him,
they burned him in his house, and slew all his followers
with fire and sword.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_365" id="fnanchor_365"></a><a href="#footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Civil war in Man.</span>
Directly after, we read of a civil
war in the isle of Man itself, in which the leaders of both
parties were killed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_366" id="fnanchor_366"></a><a href="#footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></span>
The Norwegian story tells us
nothing of all this; it conceives Godred as still living at
the time of the expedition of Magnus, and Lagman as
acting under his father.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_367" id="fnanchor_367"></a><a href="#footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></span>
The Manx version, though
confused in its chronology and mixed up with some
legendary details, gives the more intelligible story of the
two. We see a time of confusion in Man, Ireland, and
the Sudereys, which the Norwegian King tries to turn to
his own advantage. The slaughter of his candidate for
the island crown might have been looked on as ground
for war by princes more scrupulous in such matters than
Magnus Barefoot.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Signs and wonders.</span>
A King of the Northmen could hardly set out on a
great enterprise without signs and wonders; but the
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
signs and wonders which marked the expedition of
Magnus are of a different kind from those which marked
the expedition of Harold Hardrada. Or rather, one of
the two elements which we see in the tale of Harold
had, in the thirty years which had passed, waxed strong
enough to drive out the other. In the days of Harold
the omens and visions still savour of the old times of
Scandinavian heathendom. Saint Olaf indeed appears in
his character of a Christian martyr, to remind us that we
are reading the deeds of baptized men; but the general
tone is that of the worshippers of Thor and Odin.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_368" id="fnanchor_368"></a><a href="#footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></span>
But
the tale which is now told of Magnus is a mere piece of
every-day mediæval hagiology. It reminds us of some
of the tales which are told of William the Great and of
others.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_369" id="fnanchor_369"></a><a href="#footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Legend of Magnus and Saint Olaf.</span>
Magnus, great-nephew of Saint Olaf, is seized
with an irreverent longing to test the truth of the boast
that the body of his martyred kinsman had not seen
corruption. The body, first buried in a sandhill near
Nidaros or Trondhjem, was soon, like those of our own
Harold and Waltheof, translated to a worthier place in
the great church of Nidaros. Its incorruption had been
already proved, and in their new place the holy remains
wrought wonders of healing and deliverance.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_370" id="fnanchor_370"></a><a href="#footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></span>
But now,
heedless of the remonstrances of the bishop and his
clergy, Magnus bade that the shrine should be opened,
that he might see whether it was even as the tale went.
He saw and believed; and he not only believed but
trembled. He rushed out of the church, smitten with
sudden fear. In the night the martyr appeared to him
and gave him his choice of two forms of punishment. He
must either lose his kingdom and his life within thirty
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
days, or else he must set forth from Norway and never
see the land again. <span class="sni">His fleet.</span>
Magnus gathered together his wise
men; he told them the vision, and by their advice, he
chose the second alternative, by far the less terrible to a
king of the seas.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_371" id="fnanchor_371"></a><a href="#footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></span>
He set forth, but it was on an errand
of conquest, at the head of a fleet of a hundred and sixty
ships, a number far less than that of the mighty armada
which had come together at the bidding of his grandfather.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_372" id="fnanchor_372"></a><a href="#footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>The teller of this tale has either misplaced the date
of the real or supposed vision, or else he has mixed up
the present voyage of Magnus with a later one. Magnus
certainly saw Norway again after that one of his expeditions
which alone directly touches English history.
<span class="sni">Magnus at Orkney.</span>
He first sailed to the Orkneys, where the brother earls,
the sons of Thorfinn and Ingebiorg, the half-brothers
of Duncan of Scotland, still reigned.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_373" id="fnanchor_373"></a><a href="#footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></span>
Their reign now
ended. <span class="sni">He seizes the earls.</span>
On what ground we are not told, Paul and
Erling, the allies of his grandfather, were dealt with by
Magnus as enemies. They were made prisoners, and
were sent to Norway, where they afterwards died.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_374" id="fnanchor_374"></a><a href="#footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></span>
<span class="sni">He gives the earldom to Sigurd.</span>

rule of the earldom, with a council to advise him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_375" id="fnanchor_375"></a><a href="#footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></span>
Magnus then sailed among the Sudereys, plundering,
burning, and slaying. <span class="sni">Magnus among the Sudereys;</span> His minstrels and sagamen boast
of his doings in this way in the islands of Lewis, Uist,
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">141</span>

<span class="sni">in Cantire;</span>
The only part of the isle of
Britain itself which he seems to have touched was the
long peninsula of Cantire, which might pass rather for
another island than for part of the mainland, and which
in truth formed a part of the insular realm. Thence,
we are told, he plundered such parts of the Irish and
Scottish coasts as lay within reach.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_377" id="fnanchor_377"></a><a href="#footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></span>

<span class="sni">His fruitless design on Ireland.</span>
We read too that at

<span class="sni">He occupies Man.</span>
His next point was Man, which one narrator of his

as peopling with inhabitants, from what quarter we
are not told.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_380" id="fnanchor_380"></a><a href="#footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></span>
The local chronicler tells us, doubtless
with far greater truth, that he landed on the island of
Saint Patrick,--Holm Peel, the place of the famous
castle and cathedral church&mdash;&#8203;that he was pleased with
the land, and built fortresses therein, meaning&mdash;&#8203;so at

<span class="sni">His designs.</span>
Man, once established as the seat
of a great Northern empire, would certainly have been
a standing menace to all the regions and races of the
British islands. But the dominion of Magnus over Man
was not handed on to any successor of his own house,
and during the few years which he still lived, he did not
make Man the centre of his power.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Version of Orderic.</span>
We now come near to that point in the expedition
which brings it immediately within the range of our
present history. The writer who gives us most detail
deems the exploits of Magnus so great that he lashes
himself up to his highest flight of classical rhetoric.
He paints the Norwegian king as the conqueror of the
Kyklades&mdash;&#8203;not those Kyklades of the Ægæan which his
grandfather may well enough have visited, but the other
Kyklades in the great sea, lying as it were outside the
world.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_382" id="fnanchor_382"></a><a href="#footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></span>
To match this unlooked-for definition of the
Western islands, the winds which filled the sails of Magnus
are honoured with unusual names; and, by a sad relapse
into paganism Amphitritê seems to be called up as a
special guardian of the English shore.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_383" id="fnanchor_383"></a><a href="#footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></span>
Of the two islands
which bore the name of Mevania, both of which had
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
obeyed the Bretwalda Eadwine, Magnus was already
master of one; he now drew near to the other. <span class="sni">He approaches Anglesey.</span>
We are
told that he sent a small part of his fleet, consisting of six
ships, to some unnamed point of the more strictly English
shore, bearing a red shield as a sign that their purposes
were peaceful.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_384" id="fnanchor_384"></a><a href="#footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Preparations for resistance.</span>
But the people of Britain of all races
seem to have put little faith in the peaceful purposes of
the Northmen. A vast host, French and English, presently
came together from all parts of the dominions of
the two Mercian earls. The meeting-place is said to have
been at Dwyganwy on the peninsula opposite Anglesey,
the scene of the fall of Robert of Rhuddlan.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_385" id="fnanchor_385"></a><a href="#footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The fleet off Aberlleiniog.</span>
But there
can be no doubt that the scene of the tale which we
have to tell lies on the opposite shore of Anglesey, and
seemingly hard by the newly restored castle of Aberlleiniog.
Most likely the sea then came in further over
the low and marshy ground, and nearer to the castle-mound,
than it does now. Both the earls were on the
spot; the younger Hugh of Shrewsbury had been the first
to come, and he had had to wait some days for his allies.
At last the Norwegian ships were seen at sea near the
coast, and the inhabitants were running to and fro for
fear. By this time the forces of Hugh of Chester must
have come up; but it is Hugh of Shrewsbury, the younger
and more active of the pair, who plays the chief part
in the story. He mounted his horse, and rode backwards
and forwards along the shore, bringing his followers
together, lest the invaders should land and overcome
them piecemeal.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_386" id="fnanchor_386"></a><a href="#footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></span>
In his zeal he rode so near to the water
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
as to come within reach of the advancing tide and within
bow-shot of the Norwegian ships. Two archers on the
ship of King Magnus spied him out, and took aim. His
body was so well guarded by his coat of mail that it
was his face only that supplied a mark for the archers.
Of these one was King Magnus himself; the other was
a warrior from Halagoland, the most northern part of the
strictly Norwegian shore. The arrow shot by the King’s
comrade struck and turned aside from the nose-piece of
the Earl’s helmet. The shaft sent by the King’s own
hand went yet more truly to its mark; it pierced the eye
of Hugh and went through his head. Hugh the Proud
sank, and perished amid the advancing waves.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_387" id="fnanchor_387"></a><a href="#footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></span>
He died
by a stroke like that by which the elder Harold fell on
Senlac; and we could almost wish that it had been the
hand of the younger Harold that sent the shaft.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Norwegian and Welsh versions.</span>
That shaft was, according to the monk of Saint Evroul,
sent by the hand of Magnus, but by the special instigation
of the devil. To the minstrels of Norway the death
of Earl Hugh seemed a worthy exploit. They sang,
not of a single shot, but of a fierce battle, in which the
Norwegian king, lord of the islands, met the Welsh
earls<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_388" id="fnanchor_388"></a><a href="#footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></span>
face to face. They told how the arrows rattled
on the coats of mail, and how the King’s own arrow
overthrew Earl Hugh the Proud by the waters of Anglesey.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_389" id="fnanchor_389"></a><a href="#footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></span>
The British chronicler too tells us, if not of
the fierce struggle described by the Northern poet, yet
of arrows shot on both sides, alike from the ships
and by the defenders of the land.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_390" id="fnanchor_390"></a><a href="#footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></span>
All agree that it
was by the royal hand that the Earl fell. But it is
only from Saint Evroul that we hear that Magnus shot
Hugh unwittingly, and that he mourned when he knew
who it was whom he had slain. <span class="sni">Peace between Magnus and Hugh of Chester.</span>
It is added that he at
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>

Chester, declaring that he had no hostile purposes against

<p>The words which we have just seen put into the mouth
of Magnus are words of doubtful meaning, and they
might imply a claim to Anglesey, as well as to the other
islands. <span class="sni">Designs of Magnus on Anglesey.</span>
That Magnus came thither with purposes of
conquest we may set down as certain; it is less clear
whether those purposes were carried out, even for a
moment. In Norway it was believed that the overthrow
of Earl Hugh put the King of the Northmen in possession
of Anglesey, which is strangely spoken of as a third
of the British land.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_395" id="fnanchor_395"></a><a href="#footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></span>
In Man it was said that Magnus,
having slain one earl and put another to flight, occupied
Anglesey, but that he was persuaded by the Welsh, on
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
the payment of a heavy ransom, to leave the island and
sail back to Man.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_396" id="fnanchor_396"></a><a href="#footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></span>
Certain it is that, if Magnus took
any real possession of Anglesey, it was a momentary
possession indeed. According to the British chroniclers,
he sailed away at once, so that his coming and the death
of one of the earls did not really hinder the joint work of
the two. <span class="sni">Anglesey and North Wales subdued by Hugh.</span>
For a moment Anglesey, and with it seemingly
the greater part of North Wales, was brought more
thoroughly than ever under Norman or English rule.
The phrase by which the Welsh writer sets forth the
result has a strange sound; but it does not badly describe
the final work of these endless wars. The French, he
says, made the people become Saxons.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_397" id="fnanchor_397"></a><a href="#footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></span>
But for the
present this work was done only for a moment. In the
course of the next year, Anglesey was again, neither in
French nor in Saxon, but in British hands.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_398" id="fnanchor_398"></a><a href="#footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="line146_17" id="line146_17"></a>We shall hear again of Magnus in the revolutions both

he seems to have
sailed, first to Man and then to Ireland. There he
made a truce with Murtagh, and, at a later time, he
married the daughter of the Irish king to his own
son Sigurd. <span class="sni">Sigurd’s kingdom.</span>

Of his kingdom Cantire formed a part;
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
the peninsula had been formally taken possession of by
the Norwegian king. <span class="sni">Occupation of Cantire.</span>
This was done by a symbolic rite,
which well expressed the dominion of a king of the seas
over the land. Magnus was drawn in a ship across the

The occupation

but the expedition of Magnus took place during
the reign of Eadgar. Magnus then went back to Norway,
to receive his surname from the dress of the islanders,
the use of which he and his followers brought into their
own land. He then occupied himself for a while with
Scandinavian affairs, till his restless spirit again brought
him within the range of our story.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§ 6. <span class="title">The establishment of Robert of Bellême in England.</span><br />
1098.</p>

<p>Of the two earls who had crossed over to Anglesey to
meet with such singular ups and downs of fortune, it
was the elder who came back alive. Hugh of Chester,
Hugh the Fat, had still to rule for a few years longer till
he died a monk at Saint Werburh’s. <span class="sni">Effects of the death of Hugh of Shrewsbury.</span>
But the short-lived
reign of Hugh the Proud at Shrewsbury and Arundel had
come to an end, and his death led to important changes
in all those parts of England with which he had had
to deal, but above all in his own earldom on the Welsh
border. <span class="sni">Robert of Bellême Earl of Shrewsbury. 1098.</span>
A large part of that district, a district the most
important of all in a military point of view, passed
under the rule of the man who was at once the most
merciless of oppressors and the most skilful of military
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
engineers. The Red King and his minister had now an
opportunity of carrying out their doctrines with regard
to the redemption of lands on a grand scale. The King
was doubtless ready to be the heir of Earl Hugh, as of
all other men; but, as in the case of other men, he
was willing to allow the next kinsman to redeem the inheritance,
if he offered a becoming price. <span class="sni">He buys his brother’s possessions.</span>
So now, when
Robert of Bellême claimed the earldom and lands of his
deceased brother, he obtained a grant of them on a payment
of three thousand pounds.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_402" id="fnanchor_402"></a><a href="#footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></span>
This was nearly half
the sum for which William Rufus had made himself master
of all Normandy; but it was perhaps not too great a
price to pay for the great earldom of Shropshire with its
endless castles and lordships, for Arundel and Chichester
and the other South-Saxon lands of Roger of Montgomery,
and for the rest of his possessions scattered over
many English shires. <span class="sni">Extent of his estates.</span>
Robert of Bellême, specially so called
as the son of his mother, but who was no less Robert of
Montgomery as the son of his father, and who now became
no less Robert of Arundel and of Shrewsbury, thus
joined together in his own person three inheritances, any
one of which alone might have set him among princes.
<span class="sni">Doubtful policy of the grant.</span>
One might doubt whether William the Conqueror would
have been tempted by any price to allow the accumulation
of such vast powers in the hands of one man,
and that a man whose homage was not due to himself
only. But with William the Red the services and the
payments of Robert of Bellême together outweighed any
thought of the policy which might have led him rather
to bestow the vacant earldom and other lands on some
other among the sons of Earl Roger. Robert was now at
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
the height of his power and his fame&mdash;&#8203;such fame as his
was&mdash;&#8203;beyond the sea. <span class="sni">Position of Robert on the continent.</span>
We shall read in the next chapter
of his doings in Maine this very year, the doings of which
he now received the reward. To the Norman heritage
of his father, to the marchlands which he had inherited
from his mother, to the lands which mother and son
had snatched from so many Norman and Cenomannian
holders, Robert now added all that his father had received
from the Conqueror’s grant among the conquered
English, and all that his father had won for himself
among the half-conquered Welsh.</p>

<p><span class="sni">His new position in England.</span>
The establishment of Robert of Bellême in England
marks an epoch in our story. Though we have already
so often heard of him, not only in continental affairs but
in the affairs of our own island, he had not yet, as far as
we can see, held any English possessions at all; certainly
he had none which put him on a level with the great
Norman land-owners. From this time he is something
more than merely one among them; he at once begins to
play the part of the foremost among them, foremost alike
in power and in ambition. His namesake, Robert of
Mortain and of Cornwall, had held as great a number of
English acres, and his death had handed over the vast
heritage to his son. <span class="sni">Comparison with the Counts of Mortain.</span>
But neither of the Counts of Mortain
had any personal gifts which could win for them the
personal position which was held by Robert of Bellême.
The father was sluggish; the son was turbulent; neither
of them was the peer of the great captain and engineer
who was now to lord it over the British march. Nor did
the nature and position of his estates give to the grandson
of Herleva the same advantages which belonged to
the son of Mabel. The one was, bating the title of Earl,
as great in Cornwall as the other was in Shropshire;
but the lord of Cornwall might, if he chose, sleep idly,
while the lord of Shropshire was driven to constant
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
action against a restless enemy. Each had a great position
in Sussex; but the position of the lord of Arundel
and Chichester was practically higher than that of the
lord of Pevensey. The vast scattered possessions held by
the Count of Mortain throughout England added more to
his wealth than to his political power. <span class="sni">Comparison of Robert of Bellême and Hugh of Chester.</span>
Earl Hugh of
Chester was in his own earldom even greater than
Robert was in his; but Earl Hugh was growing old, and
ambitious as he was, he seems to have kept his ambition
within certain geographical bounds, in those regions of
Normandy and of Britain which destiny seemed to have
set before him. <span class="sni">Unique position of Robert.</span>
There can be no doubt that, at this
moment, Robert of Bellême held a position in England
which he shared with no rival in the island, and which
was backed by a power beyond sea which put him rather
on a level with sovereign dukes and counts than with
ordinary nobles.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Effects of his coming.</span>
To the men of the borderland, of whatever race, the
change of masters was a frightful one. To the settled
inhabitants, Norman and English, it must have been like
yet another foreign conquest. The change is marked in
the change of name; the surname of the new lord comes
from the lands of his mother which lay beyond the bounds
either of England or of Normandy. Hugh of Montgomery
is exchanged for Robert of Bellême. <span class="sni">Robert a stranger in England.</span>
The new master from
the march of Normandy and Maine must, twenty-nine
years after the conquest of Shropshire, have seemed a
stranger, not only to Englishmen, but to Normans of the
first settlement, still more so to men who were of Norman
parentage but of English birth. In its personal aspect
the change of lords must have been a matter of shuddering.
The rule of Earl Roger had been tolerable; the
four years of Earl Hugh we have seen spoken of as a
reign of special mildness, at least for his own people.
But now they had a lord of another kind. English and
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
Welsh, we are told, had smiled at the tales of the deeds
of Robert in other lands; <span class="sni">Cruelty of the new earl.</span>
they listened to them as to the
song of the bard or the gleeman, deeming that, if such
things were done, they were at least done far away from
themselves. But now they found in their own persons
that those tales were true, when, in the strong words of
a writer of those times, they were flayed alive by the
iron claws of Earl Robert.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_403" id="fnanchor_403"></a><a href="#footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></span>
The Earl himself, great as
he was in power and wealth, was only puffed up by what
he had to hanker after yet more. <span class="sni">His spoliations.</span>
He spared no man, of
whatever race or order, whose lands lay conveniently to
his hand, nor did he scruple to take away from the
saints themselves what the men of the elder time had
given to them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_404" id="fnanchor_404"></a><a href="#footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>But Robert of Bellême was something more than an
ordinary plunderer; he was a man of genius in his way;
whatever he either inherited or seized on was sure to be
strengthened by the best engineering skill of his time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_405" id="fnanchor_405"></a><a href="#footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His skill in castle-building.</span>
In
the gradual work of planting both England and Normandy
with castles he had no small share; and his skill is nowhere
more to be admired than in the way in which he adapted
his designs to the varying circumstances of different
places. He built at Bridgenorth and he built at Gisors;
there is little that is alike in the two fortresses, because
there is little that is alike in the position of the two
points which those fortresses severally had to defend.
The former, Robert of Bellême’s great creation on English
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
ground, held a most important place in the defences of the
middle course of the Severn. <span class="sni">His defence of Shropshire.</span>
The Welsh wars of this
reign had brought that whole line of country into renewed
importance. If the power of England under her
Norman masters was stretching further and further over
the British lands, that very advance laid the English lands
more and more open to passing and occasional British
ravages. The experience of such warfare within the
English border was quite fresh. <span class="sni">1094.</span>
When Robert of Bellême
took his earldom, four years only had passed since Shropshire
and Herefordshire had been laid waste,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_406" id="fnanchor_406"></a><a href="#footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></span>
just as in
the old days when Gruffydd smote the Saxon at Rhyd-y-Groes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_407" id="fnanchor_407"></a><a href="#footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></span>
The new Earl of Shropshire therefore found
it needful to strengthen the whole line of defences of the
Severn. <span class="sni">Early history of the Shropshire fortresses.</span>
Strong as was the capital of his earldom on its
peninsular height, it was well to have, in the rear of
Shrewsbury, another great fortress on a lower point of
the river, a point whose importance is witnessed by its
name; it is emphatically the <em>Bridge</em>. The whole region
had been carefully fortified, perhaps in earlier days still,
certainly in the days when the Dane as well as the
Briton had to be guarded against. <span class="sni">896.</span>
In the last campaign
of Ælfred, the Danes, finding it expedient to leave the
neighbourhood of London, had marched across the whole
breadth of England from Thames to Severn, and had
<dfn>wrought</dfn> a <dfn>work</dfn> beside that river at <span class="place">Quatbridge</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_408" id="fnanchor_408"></a><a href="#footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Æthelflæd fortifies Bridge (north). 912.</span>
Sixteen
years later, the victorious Lady, the guardian of the
Mercian land, had <em>timbered</em> the <em>burh</em> at <span class="place">Bridge</span>. At a
somewhat lower point, the enemy against whom Ælfred
and his daughter had to strive has left his memory
in the name of Danesford. The <span class="place">Bridge</span> was the site
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
of the chosen stronghold of Robert of Bellême. But
when his discerning eye marked the spot for a great
military centre, he did but do afresh what had been
already done by the native guardian of England. The
fortress of Robert of Bellême was but a calling into
fresh being, a strengthening with new works, of the older
fortress of Æthelflæd.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_409" id="fnanchor_409"></a><a href="#footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>It is somewhat singular that in the line of defence
traced by Robert’s father so commanding a site as that
of the Bridge did not hold the first place. The strong
place of Roger of Montgomery lies between three and
four miles lower down the river. <span class="sni">Older mound of Quatford.</span>
There, on the
left, the English, side of the Severn, we meet with the
first&mdash;&#8203;first to one going up the stream&mdash;&#8203;of our present
group of fortresses. A bold height, of no very great
positive elevation, marks the position of the church and
mound of Quatford, standing side by side, as is so often
seen both in our own island and beyond sea. The mound
is a natural height rising close above the river, ditched
and scarped as was needed, but raised only slightly
above its original height. <span class="sni">Quatford Castle.</span>
This elder fortification, the
dwelling-place of some English thegn of the old time,
seems to have given way, either before or after the
coming of the Norman, to a stronghold a little way further
up the river, which still bears the name of Quatford
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">154</span>
Castle. A sandstone hill, standing isolated, near to the
river but not immediately on its banks, was, like the
smaller and older post, improved and raised into a castle
mound, perhaps by Earl Roger himself, perhaps by some
earlier holder. <span class="sni">Earl Roger’s house.</span>
There the Survey records his new house
and his borough; and we may fairly see his work in the
well which still remains bored deep in the heart of the
rock.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_410" id="fnanchor_410"></a><a href="#footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></span>
In the days of King Eadward the lordship of
Eardington had been held by Saint Mildburh of Wenlock.
<span class="sni">His chapel.</span>
But, if Earl Roger, who passes for the refounder
of that house,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_411" id="fnanchor_411"></a><a href="#footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></span>
did any wrong to its patroness, he may
be held to have atoned for it by the collegiate chapel
which he raised at Quatford. It was founded at the
request of his wife, not the proud and cruel Mabel, but
her pious and gentle successor Adeliza. A pleasing
legend is told of the origin of the chapel and of the
house, a legend which, if it contains any kernel of truth,
points to Earl Roger as having been the first to occupy
Quatford Castle as a dwelling, and which may account
for the restoration of the far more tempting site of the old
fortress of the Lady being left to be the work of his son.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_412" id="fnanchor_412"></a><a href="#footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
The new rule now began, and the home of Roger and
Adeliza was forsaken by Earl Robert for the far stronger
point higher up the river, and on the opposite, the right
or Welsh bank.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_413" id="fnanchor_413"></a><a href="#footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Robert of Bellême removes to Bridge (north).</span>
Here, in contrast to the mere fords at
other points, to Quatford itself and to the Danesford
above it, stood the <em>bridge</em> which still forms so marked a
feature, and which had given the spot its name. <span class="place">Bridge</span>
then, the stronghold of Æthelflæd, became the stronghold
of Robert of Bellême; and now, perhaps from its position
with regard to his father’s dwelling at Quatford, it came
to be specially distinguished as <span class="place">Bridgenorth</span>. A steep
cliff overhangs the river at a point where the opposite
ground is high, where the stream is far wider than it
again becomes lower down, and where the channel is
divided by an island, such as those by which the Danes
loved to anchor, whether in the Seine or in the Severn.
<span class="sni">Oldbury.</span>
And, as the Danes are recorded to have <em>wrought</em> a <em>work</em>
in clear distinction from the <em>burh</em> which the Lady afterwards
<em>timbered</em>, we are tempted to see that work in
a mound not far from the bridge, and on the same side
as the river, but not rising immediately above the river’s
banks. A natural height has been ditched, scarped, and
raised to a level somewhat lower than that of the cliff
immediately above the stream, the cliff which was chosen
for the fortress, first of the Lady and then of the rebel
Earl. It is plainly in opposition to this last that the place
had, before the time of Domesday, received the name of
Oldbury, which is still borne by the parish in which it
stands.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_414" id="fnanchor_414"></a><a href="#footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></span>
The cliff itself, the site of the castle and town of
Bridgenorth, has a peninsular shape so strongly marked
that it is hard to believe that the river runs on one side of
it only, and that Bridgenorth and Oldbury are divided, not
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
by a stream, but by a dry valley, in those days doubtless
not dry, but marshy. <span class="sni">Oldbury and Bridgenorth.</span>
The sites of the older and the newer
fortress still look on one another, though the older has
again become only a grassy mound, while the younger
grew into a fortress, parish, and town, and still remains a
parliamentary borough.</p>

<p>The position of the great fortress of the oppressor is a
noble one. The mere height of the cliff at Bridgenorth
is so much lower than many of the surrounding hills
of that lovely region that it makes less show than might
have been looked for in the general view. But, as we
stand close under it on the other side of the river,
we feel that Bridgenorth needs only buildings of equal
majesty on its height to make it rank with Lincoln, with
Le Mans, almost with Laon itself. But against the
proud minsters of those cities Bridgenorth has nothing
to set in its general view save two church towers, one of
them modern, whose ugliness is not relieved by the fact
that it represents the castle church, the college of Bridgenorth,
transferred thither by Robert of Bellême, when
he moved castle, church, and everything from their older
home at Quatford. <span class="sni">Bridgenorth castle;</span>
But Bridgenorth still keeps one object
of surpassing interest in our present story, that which is
of a truth the very cradle and kernel of the place,
the shattered keep of Robert of Bellême. <span class="sni">Robert’s keep.</span>
There we have
the good luck which we enjoy but seldom in examining
the military remains of this age, the strongholds of the
men of the Conquest and their immediate successors.
Most commonly we light on little more than the mere
site, or the works of earlier or of later times; it is
only now and then that we actually see, in however
imperfect a state, some piece of genuine masonry belonging
to the time with which we are dealing. This
satisfaction we have in no small measure at Bridgenorth.
There is the square keep of the terrible founder of the
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pageno">157</span>
fortress, broken down, riven asunder by some explosion
in the warfare of later times&mdash;&#8203;what is left of it driven
to overhang its base like the tower of Caerphilly or the
<span class="place" lang="it" xml:lang="it">Muro Torto</span> of Rome&mdash;&#8203;but still keeping its main and
distinctive features, still showing, in its flat pilasters, its
double-splayed windows,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_415" id="fnanchor_415"></a><a href="#footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></span>
the traces of its double-sloped
roof with the deep gutter,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_416" id="fnanchor_416"></a><a href="#footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></span>
what that stern, hard, tower
was when the Devil of Bellême first called it into being.
We can just trace the gateway which the keep commanded
between the inner and outer courts of the castle,
and we can see the ruins of the advanced building which
sheltered the actual entrance of the keep itself. The
square tower, so characteristic of Norman military work,
is after all so rare in this its earlier form that every
such fragment as this of Bridgenorth calls for most attentive
study. Here we see the highest advances in
the art of defence, as practised by the man whose name
makes us shudder through almost every page of our
story. At Bridgenorth nature had done almost everything.
The tall and steep cliff called for nothing to be
done in the way of mounds and ditches. It was enough
to fence in the height&mdash;&#8203;that the Lady had doubtless done
after the fashion of her age&mdash;&#8203;and to raise the keep&mdash;&#8203;the
distinctive feature of Earl Robert’s age&mdash;&#8203;as the last
shelter in case of attack from the land side. <span class="sni">The churches and town of Bridgenorth.</span>
We can
trace the inner and outer courts, the latter containing the
unsightly church which represents the college within the
castle. The other church stands nearly on a level with
the castle, parted from the castle hill by a dip which
takes the form of a steep road--<dfn>Cartway</dfn> is the name it
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
still keeps&mdash;&#8203;leading down from the town to the river.
Few stronger or more striking sites of its own scale
could have been found. The Castle by the Bridge is not
a mountain fortress; far higher hills than the hill of
Bridgenorth or the hill of Quatford come within the
general view. But the stronghold of Æthelflæd and
Robert served better than any loftier point could have
done for its own immediate work. No other point
could have served so well to guard the most important
point of the river, and to shelter the older borders of
England against any desperate attempt of the Britons to
carry their endless warfare far within her later borders.
<span class="sni">The group of fortresses.</span>
The whole group, Bridgenorth, Oldbury, the two Quatfords,
are a succession of strongholds which form a whole.
All are within sight of one another, though it might be
hard to find a point which directly commands all four at
once. <span class="sni">Burf Castle.</span>
A little further inland, on the Quatford side of
the river, a broad hill, fenced in by a slight earthwork,
and known as Burf Castle, commands the widest and
most striking view of all, the round back of the Wrekin,
the sharp rise and fall of the Titterstone, with a boundless
view over the lower country to the north-east. This
is undoubtedly the site of an early stronghold, which may
have played its part in the days of the Lady or in the
old time before her. But there is no sign that it entered
into the military reckoning of Roger of Montgomery or
of Robert of Bellême.</p>

<p class="p2">The great engineering works at Bridgenorth seem to
have occupied the mind of Earl Robert during the whole
of the few remaining years of his English career. We
shall find that they were not fully finished four years
later. <span class="sni">Robert builds the castle of Careghova.</span>
At the same time, while he fenced in Bridgenorth
in the rear of the capital of his earldom, he raised
another stronghold in advance of it, within the later
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span>
Welsh border, at Careghova, immediately on Offa’s
Dyke.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_417" id="fnanchor_417"></a><a href="#footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></span>
And he was at the same time extending his
possessions in a more peaceful region, where no inroads
of Britons or Northmen were to be feared. <span class="sni">His Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire estates.</span>
On the
borders of Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire stood a
chief seat of one who, in the extent of his possessions,
ranked as one of the foremost men in England. This
was Roger of Bully, who took his name from a Norman
lordship in the land of Braye, lying west of what was to
be the New Castle of King Henry, on the high ground
which overlooks the forest of Saint-Saen, the home of
the faithful Helias. <span class="sni">Roger of Bully.</span>
The name of Roger of Bully&mdash;&#8203;the
spellings of the name are endless&mdash;&#8203;is less commonly mentioned
in our tale than we might have looked for. He
was a great land-owner in Yorkshire; he was one of the
greatest land-owners in Nottinghamshire, and he held
considerable estates in other parts of England. He had
supplanted two English earls in their special homes; he
sat by the hearth of Eadwine and by the hearth of
Waltheof; in another spot, the holdings of ten English
thegns had been rolled together into a single lordship
to enrich the fortunate stranger.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_418" id="fnanchor_418"></a><a href="#footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His Yorkshire estates.</span>
Among his Yorkshire
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">160</span>
estates he held the exceptionally favoured lands of
Sprotburgh and Barnburgh, which had remained untouched
in the general harrying of Northumberland.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_419" id="fnanchor_419"></a><a href="#footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></span>
He seems to have won the special favour of the greatest
ladies of the Conqueror’s court; if he held the hall of
Hallam, the hall of Waltheof, it was by the gift of
Waltheof’s widow Judith;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_420" id="fnanchor_420"></a><a href="#footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></span>
and an estate which he
held in distant Devonshire is set down as the gift of
Queen Matilda herself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_421" id="fnanchor_421"></a><a href="#footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></span>
Yet this man, who holds so
great a place in the Survey, plays no visible part in
history; he lives only in the record of Domesday and in
his still abiding work in a minster and a castle of his
own rearing. Just within the borders of Yorkshire, at
no great distance from the shires both of Nottingham
and Lincoln, Roger had occupied an English dwelling-place,
entered in the Survey as Dadesley, but which
afterwards grew into greater note by the name of Tickhill.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_422" id="fnanchor_422"></a><a href="#footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Position of Tickhill.</span>
Like many other dwelling-places of English lords,
Dadesley or Tickhill must have been chosen simply as
a convenient centre for the estates of its owner. It is
no natural stronghold; the post seems to have no special
military advantages; it crowns no steep, it commands
no river, it bars the entrance to no valley. <span class="sni">The castle.</span>
A low hill
of sandstone was improved by art into one of the usual
mounds, and it had been in King Eadward’s day the
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">161</span>
possession of Ælfsige and Siward. The mound, as in
other places, was in after time taught to bear a polygonal
keep, and its sides were themselves strengthened by
masonry. The keep, of which the foundations only are
left, was of later date than the days with which we
are concerned. And we may fully believe that parts
at least of the circuit wall of the castle, and still more,
that the elder parts of the gatehouse, with a face of
ornaments and sculptures which almost remind us of
the work of the great Emperor’s day at Lorsch, are due
to the taste, such as it was, of the first Norman lord of
Tickhill.</p>

<p>The nomenclature of the lands of Roger of Bully
has been singularly shifting. Dadesley gave way to
Tickhill. But Tickhill is not the only name borne by
Roger’s stronghold. It not uncommonly takes the name
of a more certain memorial of him which lies only a few
miles off, but within the bounds of another shire. <span class="sni">The priory of Blyth, founded 1088.</span>
In
the year of the first rebellion of the Red King’s reign,
Roger of Bully had founded a monastery dependent on
the abbey of the Holy Trinity at Rouen. It was reared on
a point of his possessions known as Blyth, lying within
the borders of Nottinghamshire, and near a river which
joins the old historic stream of the Idle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_423" id="fnanchor_423"></a><a href="#footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></span>
The nave of
Roger’s church still stands; there is no mistaking the
distinguishing marks of the earliest Norman style, even
in a building whose loftiness and narrowness have more
in common with later forms of art.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_424" id="fnanchor_424"></a><a href="#footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></span>
Blyth became at
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pageno">162</span>
least as famous as Tickhill. <span class="sni">Name of Blyth and Tickhill used indiscriminately.</span>
The castle, with the honour
of which it formed the head, is called by both names,
and we shall find as we go on that the same incident
in our story is placed by some of our authorities at
Blyth and by others at Tickhill.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_425" id="fnanchor_425"></a><a href="#footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Death of Roger of Bully.</span>
Roger, founder of
both castle and monastery, seems to have died about
the time when Robert of Bellême was strengthening
himself at Bridgenorth and Careghova. His lands went
at once to swell the possessions of the terrible Earl. On
some plea of kindred, Robert demanded them of the
King. <span class="sni">The lands of Roger of Bully granted to Robert of Bellême.</span>
William was as ready to grant him the lands
of Blyth and Hallam as he had been to grant him the
earldom of Shropshire and the other possessions of his
father. But he was no more inclined than he was then
to grant anything without a consideration. Earl Robert
was allowed to redeem the heritage of his kinsman, but
to redeem it only on payment of a great sum.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_426" id="fnanchor_426"></a><a href="#footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Impolicy of the grant.</span>
We
may again doubt whether William the Great would have
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">163</span>
allowed such a redemption, even in the days when he had
fallen into covetousness and greediness he loved withal.
With the Conqueror neither greediness nor anything else
ever came before policy. He whose policy it had been
to separate Norman and English estates in the second
generation, who had taken care that no son of his own
chosen friend should hold Breteuil and Hereford in a
single hand,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_427" id="fnanchor_427"></a><a href="#footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></span>
would surely never have allowed any one
man to have reached the gigantic height of wealth and
power which was now reached by Robert of Bellême.
<span class="sni">Greatness of Robert of Bellême.</span>
The gathering together of such vast possessions in Normandy
and England in the hands of one who had some
pretensions to rank as a prince beyond the bounds of
Normandy and England almost amounted to a direct
challenge to their owner to dispute the great lesson of
Rochester, and to see whether there was not at least
one subject in England whom the King of England could
not control.</p>

<p>That question had yet to be tried, and to be tried
in the person of the new lord of Tickhill. But it
was not raised during the short remnant of the days
of William the Red. The two powers of evil contrived
to pull together in friendly guise as long as the
days of unlaw and unright lasted. And the longer those
days lasted, the blacker and the bitterer they grew.
The greater the power and wealth which was gathered
together in the hands of Robert of Bellême, the greater,
we are told, was the pride and cruelty of that son of
Belial.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_428" id="fnanchor_428"></a><a href="#footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></span>
He may by this time have grown weary of
oppression in the familiar scenes of his evil deeds on
both sides of the sea. The death of Robert of Bully
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
opened to him a new and wide human hunting-ground
in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. But his hold on
all that he had within our island was fated to be short.
We are drawing near to the end of the reign and the life
of William Rufus, and, when the reign and life of William
Rufus were over, the English power of Robert of Bellême
did not last long.</p>

<p class="p2">But before we come to the last days of the Red King
in his island kingdom, we must again cross the sea, to
follow the warlike campaigns of his latest days, to trace
out the wide-reaching schemes of dominion which filled
his restless soul, his fitful energy in beginning enterprises,
his strange waywardness in leaving them half
done. And now will come the living contrast between
unright, as embodied in William Rufus, and right, as
embodied this time, not in a man of the church and the
cloister, but in a man of his own order, a layman, a
prince, a soldier. We have had one chapter where the
main interest has gathered round Anselm of Aosta; we
are now coming to another in which the main interest
will gather round Helias of La Flèche.</p>

1097&ndash;1099.</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap negindent">THE latter years of the reign of the Red King,
<span class="sni">Character of the last years of Rufus. 1097&ndash;1100.</span> beginning
from the departure of Anselm, are far richer
in foreign than in domestic events. Even within the isle
of Britain we have, as we have already seen, chiefly to
deal with the lands which lie beyond the actual English
kingdom. Scotland has received a king at the bidding
of the over-lord in England. A deep plan has been laid
for the better subjugation of the seemingly unconquerable
Welsh. A Norwegian king has slain an earl of
England in strife on the shore of a Welsh island. But
within England itself the greatest event which we have
had to record has been the immediate result of that
distant strife in the succession to an English earldom.
When Robert of Bellême became the most powerful
subject in England, it was undoubtedly an event of no
small importance both at the moment and in its results.
It added perceptibly to the evils even of the reign of
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
unlaw. Still it was not in itself an event on the same
scale as the rebellion of Odo or the rebellion of Robert
of Mowbray, or as the beginning or the ending of the
dealings between Anselm and the King. <span class="sni">Little to record at home, and much abroad.</span>
And the same
character of the time goes on to the end. There is
in England itself nothing to record besides the great
architectural works of the King, a few ecclesiastical
deaths and appointments, and those natural portents and
phænomena which are characteristic of the whole time,
and which come thicker upon us as we draw nearer to
the end. Beyond sea, on the other hand, this time of
less than three years is the most stirring time of the
whole reign. King of England, over-lord of Scotland,
not in form Duke of the Normans, but master of Normandy
as his brother never was, the Red King goes on
to greater schemes. Rufus seems to have been always
puffed up by success, but never cast down by bad luck.
His personal failure in Wales was really a marked contrast
to the success of Eadgar in Scotland. <span class="sni">Temper and schemes of Rufus.</span>
But Rufus
seems to have had the happy gift of plucking out of all
states of things whatever tended to gratify his pride, and
of forgetting all that looked the other way. He, or others
in his name, had set up a king at Dunfermline. This
was enough to make him put out of sight all thought
that he had in his own person marched to Snowdon and
taken nothing by his march. He felt himself more
than ever Monarch of Britain, King of kings within his
own island. We can believe that it rankled in his soul
that, outside that island, he was less than a king. The
lord of Normandy had in any case a formal over-lord in
the French King, and William Rufus was lord of Normandy
only by an anomalous and temporary title. He
held the duchy only as a merchant holds a pledge. We
can well understand how such a man would chafe at the
thought that he had anywhere even a nominal superior.
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
Such an one as William deemed himself was dishonoured
by being, even in the most nominal way, the man of
such an one as Philip. <span class="sni">His designs on France.</span>
And the noblest way of escaping
from the acknowledgement of a superior was by himself
taking that superior’s place. The Monarch of Britain
would be also Monarch of Gaul, of so much at least of
Gaul as in any sense admitted the over-lordship of Paris.
The lord of Winchester and Rouen would be lord of Paris
also. William wished for a war with France, and a war
with France could at any moment be had. The eternal
question of the Vexin stood always awaiting its solution.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Wars with France and Maine.</span>
But a war with France was not the only war which
William Rufus had now to wage on the Gaulish mainland.
He had to strive against a noble city, a valiant
people, ruled by a prince worthy of his city and his
people. Besides striving with France and Philip, he
had to strive against Maine, he had to strive against
Helias. The war with France was doubtless the object
with which he crossed the sea; but mischief had long
been brewing in the troublesome land to the south of
Normandy, and about the time when the French war
began, the standing Cenomannian difficulty grew into
open war also. William had thus two wars to wage at
once. These two wars, with France and with Maine, are
told in our narratives as if they were altogether distinct,
and had no bearing on one another. Yet the two were
going on at the same time at no great distance from one
another, and some of the chief actors on one side were
flitting to and fro between the two. <span class="sni">Beginning of war. 1097&ndash;1098.</span> It is hard to say in
which region the first actual fighting took place. In
both it must have begun in the winter after Anselm
had gone on one errand into Burgundy and Eadgar on
another into Scotland. <span class="sni">William crosses the sea.</span>
It was then that King William
crossed the sea also, with the object doubtless of making
war on France. The Cenomannian war was thrown in
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
as something incidental. The war with Maine has in
itself, as a tale, by far the greater charm of the two.
But it is needless to say that far higher interests were,
or might have been, at stake in the war with France.
Of the wide-reaching schemes of William Rufus, and of
their remarkable position among those things which
might have been but which were not, I have spoken at
some length elsewhere.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_430" id="fnanchor_430"></a><a href="#footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></span>
But it is only in its latest stage
that the war showed even any likelihood of growing
beyond the scale of a border struggle. It was, in profession
at least, a war for the Vexin, and it was in the
Vexin that it was mainly waged.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Comparison of the two wars.</span>
The result of the war was widely different in the two
cases. We may sum it up by saying that Maine was
subdued and that France was not. Maine was at least
held to be subdued. In the first Cenomannian war the
capital was taken; the prince was made a prisoner; so
much of the land as was really attacked was subdued.
In the second war the capital was taken and the prince
was driven out. But against France no real advantage
at all seems to have been gained. To modern ideas this
difference may seem no wonderful result of the difference
between the invasion of a county and the invasion of a
kingdom. <span class="sni">Comparative position of France and Maine.</span>
But in the eleventh century the resources of
Maine could not have been very greatly inferior to the
resources of France. In one sense indeed the resources
of Maine were by far the greater of the two, <span class="sni">Helias and Philip.</span>
inasmuch
as Helias reigned at Le Mans and Philip reigned at
Paris. But in truth the comparison between a county
and a kingdom is not a fair one. The France of those
days was not a kingdom; it was simply that small part
of a great kingdom which was held to obey&mdash;&#8203;which
under Philip certainly did not obey&mdash;&#8203;the nominal king
of the whole. The king was simply that one among the
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
princes of the kingdom who always claimed, and who
sometimes received, the homage of the others. <span class="sni">Advantage of the kingly dignity.</span>
We must
never underrate the vast moral advantage which the
king drew from his kingly dignity;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_431" id="fnanchor_431"></a><a href="#footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></span>
but, on the other
hand, we must not be thereby led to overrate the
material strength of the king’s actual dominion. Supposing
that the resources of Maine and of France had
been positively equal, if Helias had the advantage over
Philip that the one was Helias and that the other was
Philip, this advantage was far more than counterbalanced
by the fact that Philip was a king while Helias
was only a count. That he was a count of doubtful
title, always threatened by a neighbour more powerful
than himself, was of course a further incidental disadvantage;
but the essential difference is inherent in the
position of the two princes and their dominions. The
king, even though the king was Philip, was a king, and
men had scruples about personally attacking one who
was at once their own lord on earth and the anointed of
the Lord of Heaven. William Rufus doubtless had no
such scruples about that or about any matter; but such
scruples had been felt by his father; they were to be felt
in times to come by Henry of Le Mans and of Anjou, of
Normandy and of England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_432" id="fnanchor_432"></a><a href="#footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></span>
Such scruples would not
be felt by Normans withstanding French aggression on
their own land; we may remember how a lance from
the Côtentin had laid Philip’s father on the ground
at Val-ès-dunes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_433" id="fnanchor_433"></a><a href="#footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></span>
They would not be felt by native
Englishmen, to whom Normandy, France, and Maine,
were all alike foreign and hostile lands. But we may
suspect that there was many a knight in William’s
host who, when he went forth to invade the lands of the
lord of his lord in an utterly unprovoked quarrel, did
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">170</span>
not go forth with quite so light a heart as that with
which he went forth to win back for his lord a land of
which his lord had some shadow of ground for professing
that he had been robbed by one of his own men.</p>

<p>Maine then was, in a sense, conquered; France was not
conquered in any sense. Le Mans was taken; Paris was
hardly threatened. And this, we may believe, was at
least partly owing to the fact that Le Mans was only
the city of a count, while Paris was the city of a king.
Both lands had a champion in whom we may feel a personal
interest. <span class="sni">Lewis son of Philip.</span>
While we follow the steps of an old
acquaintance in Count Helias, we gladly watch the beginnings
of a new acquaintance, not indeed in King
Philip himself, but in his gallant son the Lord Lewis.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_434" id="fnanchor_434"></a><a href="#footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></span>
He has his special biographer, and we only wish that
the minute detail in which we can read his actions in
dealing with the immediate vassals of the French duchy
had been extended to the greater though shorter strife
which he had to wage against the sovereign of Normandy
and England.</p>

<p>It is not easy to tell the story of these two wars in
exact chronological order. <span class="sni">Beginning of the war of Maine. January, 1098.</span>
The early part of the French
war is told without any dates, while we know when
the actual fighting began in Maine. This was in the
January which followed William’s crossing to the continent,
the January of the year in which Earl Hugh
was killed in Anglesey. Whether there was any fighting
on the French border earlier than that we cannot tell.
For a later stage of the French war we have dates, and
its dated stage clearly follows the end of the first
Cenomannian war. If we go back to the causes of the
two struggles, it is equally hard to find the beginning.
In both cases there was a standing quarrel, which might
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
have broken out into war at any time. But the French
war has a certain right to precedence, inasmuch as it
was doubtless rather to attack France than to attack
Maine that William Rufus crossed the sea. It may
therefore be our best course, first to trace out the earlier
undated part of the French war down to the point where
there is a clear break in the story. We may then follow
the fortunes of Le Mans and Maine, till we reach the
later dated part of the French war which followed their
first momentary conquest.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§ 1. <span class="title">The Beginnings of the French War.</span><br />
1097&ndash;1098.</p>

<p><span class="sni">King Philip;</span>
Of Philip King of the French, the fourth king of the
house of Paris, we have often heard already, and from
what we have heard we shall hardly expect him to take
any leading part either in war or in council. <span class="sni">his adulterous marriage with Bertrada of Montfort.</span>
He is
chiefly memorable for his adulterous marriage with
Bertrada of Montfort, the wife of Fulk Rechin of Anjou.
He had got rid of his first wife, the daughter of Count
Florence of Friesland and step-daughter of that Count
Robert of Flanders who bore the Frisian name. <span class="sni">He puts away his first wife.</span>
The
mother of his son Lewis and his daughter Constance was
put away by Philip on some plea of kindred, and was
shut up in the castle of Montreuil.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_435" id="fnanchor_435"></a><a href="#footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></span>
Some years later
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span>
Bertrada became her successor. Of her and Fulk we
shall hear again in our Cenomannian story; she was in
some sort given to Fulk as the price of Cenomannian
bondage. But, as Fulk had at least one wife living,
the validity of the marriage might have been fairly
called in question. <span class="sni">Philip and Bertrada;</span>
If the scandal of the time may be
trusted, Bertrada, wearying of Fulk, and fearing that he
might deal by her as he had dealt by others, offered
herself to King Philip to supply the place which he had
made vacant.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_436" id="fnanchor_436"></a><a href="#footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></span>
She won his heart, so far as he had any,
and she seems to have been the only thing that he really
cared for. But she who had been a countess at Angers
would not be less than queen at Paris, and a ceremony
of marriage was gone through. More than one prelate
was charged with the uncanonical deed. <span class="sni">their alleged marriage by Odo. 1092.</span>
The version
which most concerns us is that which tells how, when no
prelate in France would thus profane the sacraments of
the Church, the King looked beyond the border, and
found one less scrupulous in the person of the Bishop of
Bayeux. The churches of Mantes, it is said, were Odo’s
reward for his thus pandering to the misdeeds of his
royal neighbour.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_437" id="fnanchor_437"></a><a href="#footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
<span class="sni">Scandal occasioned by the marriage.</span>
Much scandal and searching of heart followed on the
pretended marriage, scandal which spread throughout all
France, throughout all Gaul, throughout all Christendom.
<span class="sni">Opposition of Ivo and Hugh of Lyons.</span>
The famous Bishop Ivo of Chartres protested in
many letters to the King and others.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_438" id="fnanchor_438"></a><a href="#footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></span>
If a council
of the prelates of France, gathered by the King’s authority
at Rheims, was inclined to deal gently with the
royal sinner, there were higher ecclesiastical powers
who were more unbending. Archbishop Hugh of Lyons,
Primate of all the Gauls, no subject of Parisian dukes
or kings, but a prince of that Imperial Burgundy which
knew no king but Cæsar, gathered an assembly which
spoke in another voice. The friend of Anselm, the friend
of Urban, called together the bishops of the Gauls at
Autun, and their voice denounced the offence which the
bishops of France alone had been inclined to pass over.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_439" id="fnanchor_439"></a><a href="#footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></span>
Higher powers still spoke at Piacenza and at Clermont.
<span class="sni">Excommunication of Philip and Bertrada.</span>
Philip and Bertrada were excommunicated often and
absolved now and then. None would eat at their table;
the dogs were said to refuse the morsels which fell from
it. Wherever they went, the public exercise of Christian
worship stopped, though, by a somewhat inconsistent
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
indulgence, they were allowed to have a low mass said
before them in a private chapel.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_440" id="fnanchor_440"></a><a href="#footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></span>
It would seem as
though, in spiritual as well as in temporal things,
subjects were to suffer <a name="line174_4" id="line174_4"></a>from the crimes of kings, while
the kings themselves went unscathed. But when Philip
and Bertrada left any town, the bells at once struck out.
Then, with allusion no doubt to the supposed power of
the bells to chase away thunder and pestilence, the King
would say to his companion, “Do you hear, my beauty,
how they drive us away?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_441" id="fnanchor_441"></a><a href="#footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></span>
For fifteen years, allowing
perhaps for occasional times of reconciliation, the King
of the French never wore his crown or his kingly robes
or appeared in royal state at any public ceremony.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_442" id="fnanchor_442"></a><a href="#footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Sons of Philip and Bertrada.</span>
By this second marriage or adultery, which was held
to be in no way done away by the death of the lawful
Queen in prison,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_443" id="fnanchor_443"></a><a href="#footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></span>
Philip had two sons, Philip and Florus.
<span class="sni">Bertrada’s schemes against Lewis.</span>
Bertrada wished to be the mother of a king, and in after
times the lawful heir Lewis was said to have been the
object of not a few plots on the part of his step-mother,
if even step-mother she is to be called. But at this stage
Philip seems to have kept sense enough to see the merits
of his son, and to place full trust in him. By the consent
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
of his realm, he made Lewis the immediate ruler and
defender of the exposed frontier of the royal dominions.
<a name="line175_3" id="line175_3"></a>He granted him in fief the towns of Mantes and Pontoise,
and the whole French Vexin.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_444" id="fnanchor_444"></a><a href="#footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Philip invests Lewis with the Vexin. 1092.</span>
But Lewis was made more
than this. Practically, whether by any formal act or not,
Lewis became the ruler of France, so far as France just
then had any ruler. Philip, scorned and loathed of all
men, with the curses of the Church hurled over and over
again against him, withdrew from ruling, fighting, or
anything else but his own pleasures, and threw the whole
burthen of the government and defence of his kingdom
on the shoulders of his young and gallant son.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Question of the Vexin.</span>
We are not told at what exact moment the old question
of the Vexin was again first stirred. Philip was not
likely to stir it, neither was Robert; William Rufus
might not care to stir it while he was lord only of part
of Normandy, and not of the whole. But when all
Normandy became his, the old dispute naturally came
up again in his mind. He would not have been William
Rufus if he had not sought to win all that his father
had held, all that his father had claimed, and among the
rest the place where his father found his death-wound.
<span class="sni">Grounds of offence on the part of Rufus.</span>
The special acts of authority exercised by Philip in the
Vexin, the grant of the land as his son’s fief, the grant
of the churches of Mantes, the churches which were rebuilding
out of his father’s dying gifts, to his own
rebellious uncle Odo, would be likely to stir him up
still more to put forward his old claim. <span class="sni">William demands the French Vexin. 1097.</span>
At last, after
reflecting, we are told, on the wars and the fate of his
father in that region, he sent, in the year of the departure
of Anselm, solemnly to demand the cession of the whole
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
Vexin, specially naming the towns and fortresses of
Pontoise, Chaumont, and Mantes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_445" id="fnanchor_445"></a><a href="#footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></span>
Of these Mantes and
Chaumont were in the strictest sense border fortresses;
Pontoise&mdash;&#8203;the bridge on the Oise, as its name implies&mdash;&#8203;lies
far nearer the heart of the King’s territory; Pontoise
in an enemy’s hand would indeed be a standing
menace to Paris. The demands of the Red King almost
amounted to a demand for the surrender of the independence
of the French kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The demand is refused.</span>
It is needless to say that the demand was refused.

King William accordingly
crossed the sea to assert his rights, and the
French campaign possibly began before the end of the
year. It is wonderful, when we remember that it is
chiefly from our own writers that we get the details of
William Rufus’ Norman campaigns, how little they tell
us about his French campaigns. Of the war of Maine to
which we shall presently come they tell us little enough.
Still the name of Maine does appear in their pages, while
the name of France at this stage does not. <span class="sni">William crosses to Normandy. November 11&ndash;30, 1097.</span>

If the army at large is meant,
the expression is a strange one. The <dfn>hired</dfn> is the King’s
household, taking in doubtless household troops in personal
attendance on the King, like the old housecarls,
but not surely the whole force, national or mercenary.
But it was the King’s household whose excesses were
specially complained of; and this casual outburst of
bitterness is a speaking comment on the general pictures
of their misdoings which we have already come across.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_450" id="fnanchor_450"></a><a href="#footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></span>
But it is only of damage done in England by the King’s
household that our Chronicler tells us anything. <span class="sni">Silence of English writers as to the French war.</span>
Of
warlike exploits on the other side of the Channel neither
he nor any other English writer tells us at this stage a
single word.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_451" id="fnanchor_451"></a><a href="#footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>If from the silence of our own writers we turn to our
chief authority on the French side, we shall find a
vivid general picture of the war, but hardly any account
of particular events. We get indeed one of the most
striking of personal contrasts. Though the war which was
now waged by Rufus was in every sense a war waged
against France, yet it could hardly be called a war personally
waged against the nominal ruler of France. It
was a war for the Vexin, waged against the lord of the
Vexin, and, in its first stages at least, mainly confined to
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
the Vexin. <span class="sni">William and Lewis.</span>
The struggle between William and Lewis, as
it is set forth by the biographer of the French prince,
was an unequal one. William had his old weapons at
command&mdash;&#8203;the wealth of England, the traitors whom
that wealth could bribe, the mercenaries whom that
wealth could hire.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_452" id="fnanchor_452"></a><a href="#footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></span>
He had his own experience in war;
he had his veteran troops and their veteran commanders.
<span class="sni">Chief men on William’s side.</span>
Next under the King, comparatively young in years, but
first of all in daring as in wickedness, was Robert of
Bellême. Then came the King’s brother Henry, and the
well-known names of Count William of Evreux, Earl
Hugh of Chester, and the old Earl Walter of Buckingham.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_453" id="fnanchor_453"></a><a href="#footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></span>
These were formidable foes for an untried youth
like Lewis; the aged warrior who was old on the day of
Senlac must have been a strange contrast indeed to the
gallant lad on whom the fortune of France now rested.
<span class="sni">Difficulties of Lewis.</span>
Lewis had, we are told, neither men nor money nor
allies; he had to pick up all where and how he could.
Whenever, often by running to and fro as far as the
borders of Berry or Auvergne or Burgundy, he had got
together three hundred, or perhaps five hundred, knights,
he met King William of England marching against him
with ten thousand.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_454" id="fnanchor_454"></a><a href="#footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></span>
Here was little room for pitched
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">179</span>
battles; Lewis could not risk a meeting with such an
enemy in the open field. He had often to retire, sometimes
openly to fly.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_455" id="fnanchor_455"></a><a href="#footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></span>
And the different state of the
hoards of the two princes showed itself in an effect on
their military operations which is characteristic of the
time. <span class="sni">Fate of the captives on each side.</span>
When warriors on the English side&mdash;&#8203;we must use
the language of our French informant&mdash;&#8203;fell into French
hands, the price of their ransom was speedily paid.
When French warriors were made prisoners by the forces
of Rufus, there was no money to ransom them. They
had to languish in bonds with only one hope of deliverance.
Those only were set free who were willing to
become the men of the King of England and to bind
themselves by oath to fight against their own natural
lord.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_456" id="fnanchor_456"></a><a href="#footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>Some then at least of the native subjects of the French
crown, who had no conflicting engagements to plead, did
not scruple, in the extremities in which they found themselves,
to take service on behalf of the invader against
their own lord. It is therefore the less wonderful if
another class of men, whose interests and whose duties
were more doubtful, deemed, when they had to choose
between two lords, that Rufus was the lord to be chosen.
<span class="sni">French traitors.</span>
Others again were found of baser mould, who simply took
the money of the Red King, and for its sake turned
against their own people on behalf of strangers. Among
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
these one is specially marked, one who by his geographical
position was called on to be among the foremost champions
of France against Norman invasion. This was one
of the lords who commanded the fortresses on the Seine,
a man whose possessions lay close to the Norman border,
<span class="sni">Guy of the Rock.</span>
Guy of the Rock, the Rock which has taken its name from
him and which still is known as <span class="place">La Roche Guyon</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_457" id="fnanchor_457"></a><a href="#footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></span>
The
position of his chief stronghold made his adhesion of no
small importance. <span class="sni">Norman possessions beyond the Epte.</span>
The stream of Epte, flowing during
a great part of its course through a deep valley, seems
designed by nature to part Normandy and France; but,
as we have seen, the frontier was ever disputed, and here
and there the Norman held small portions of territory on
the left bank of the river. One of these Norman holdings
on the French side lies by the small village of Gasny,
where the boundary, surviving in that of the modern department,
is still marked at some distance up the opposite
hill. A slight further ascent brings the traveller in sight
of one of the noblest bends of the Seine, where the great
river, with all its islands, runs immediately below a long
line of chalk hills, with their white spurs jutting out in
endless fantastic shapes. The windings of the Seine have
in fact left at this point little more than a narrow isthmus
between itself and its lowlier tributary. <span class="sni">Roche Guyon.</span>
Just within the
French territory at this point, and commanding this
important sweep of the great French river, lay the
domains of the lord of the Rock. The ridge on which
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
the traveller stands ends in a bluff to the south-east.
There, where the hills open for another tributary of the
Seine, close by the island of Lavancourt, stood Guy’s
now vanished fortress of Vetheuil. But, as we now gaze,
by far the most prominent object in the whole curved line
of the hill, placed like the imperial seat in the centre of
an ancient amphitheatre, rising over the church, the more
modern castle, the town, and the airy bridge which
modern art has thrown across the river, soar the relics of
the fortress which still bears Guy’s name. A spur of the
hill is crowned by a small keep, with a round tower
attached to a square mass within its compass. But in
the days of the Red King, the Guy’s Cliff of the Vexin,
now the site of a castle so preeminently visible, was
specially known as the site of the stronghold that was
invisible. <span class="sni">The castle bored in the rock.</span>
The lords of the rock had, like the Kenite
of old, literally made their nest in the rock itself.
The chalk is to this day habitually bored to make
houses, churches,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_458" id="fnanchor_458"></a><a href="#footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></span>
any kind of excavation that may
be needed. In days before our time this custom had
been applied to a more dangerous use; the plundering
chiefs of the rock had scooped themselves out a castle in
its side. More than one of the chambers remain&mdash;&#8203;comfortless
to our eyes, but perhaps not more comfortless
than the chambers within many a tower of timber or
masonry&mdash;&#8203;whence these troglodyte barons looked out to
mark the craft upon the Seine, and to exact, by a custom
which lingered on till late times, a toll from every passer
by. <span class="sni">Guy submits to Rufus.</span>
Guy of the Rock now submitted to the island king,
and his submission supplied a new fetter to pen up the
king of the mainland within his havenless realm. At
the very entrance of the French territory on this side,
Guy’s Rock, Vetheuil, and all that is implied in the
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
possession of Vetheuil and of the Rock, passed from the
obedience of the lord of Paris to the obedience of the lord
of Winchester and Rouen.</p>

<p>While Guy thus sold to the invader the very entrance-gate
of the French kingdom, the Red King found another
ally in a far more famous man who held a position of at
least equal importance higher up the Seine. <span class="sni">Policy of Robert of Meulan.</span>
At the head
of the nobles who held lands of both kings stood the
acknowledged master of all subtle policy, Count Robert
of Meulan. We have been so long familiar with his
name, whether as the youthful warrior of Senlac or as
the experienced counsellor of the Red King, that we may
have almost forgotten that the title by which we call
him is French, and that he was as great a lord in France
as he was in England or in Normandy. We find it
hard to think of him as one of those who had thus
to choose between two lords, and that he might conceiveably
have chosen the cause of Philip&mdash;&#8203;or rather of
Lewis&mdash;&#8203;against William. We cannot fancy that he took
long to decide. He may have argued that William, lord
both of Normandy and of England, had two parts in
him, while Philip of France had only one. <span class="sni">He receives William’s troops.</span>
He received
the troops of the Red King into his castles, and his
adhesion was held to have been of special help to his
undertaking. He opened, we are told, a clear path for
the English into France.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_459" id="fnanchor_459"></a><a href="#footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></span>
The words sound as if they
belonged to the fourteenth, fifteenth, or sixteenth century
rather than to the last years of the eleventh. And
they are clothed with a strange significance when we
remember that the man who now opened a way into
France for the combined host of Normandy and England
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
was the same man who, two-and-thirty years before, had
opened a way into the very heart of England for the
combined host of Normandy and France.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_460" id="fnanchor_460"></a><a href="#footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></span>
But in a
geographical point of view the expression is fully justified.
<span class="sni">Importance of the position of Meulan.</span>
In a war between the lord of Rouen and the lord of
Paris, no man’s friendship could be more valuable to
either side than the friendship of the Count of Meulan.
A man weaker in fight and less wary in council than the
Achitophel of his day might, if he kept the Seine barred
as the lord of Meulan could bar it, have gone far to hold
the balance between the contending kings. As at Mantes,
as at Rouen, as at Paris itself, the islands so characteristic
of the Seine are at Meulan also brought into play for
purposes of habitation and defence. <span class="sni">Description of Meulan.</span>
Meulan indeed is,
what neither Paris nor Rouen is, at once a hill-fortress
and a river-fortress. At a point of the river lying between
Mantes, the seat of the Conqueror’s death-wound,
and Poissy, the spot where he went to crave help of his
lord before the day of Val-ès-dunes, a hill which the surrounding
valleys gird as with a natural fosse rises from
the right bank of the river. A group of islands is
formed at this spot by the branches of the winding
stream, fit places for the landing of the forefathers of the
Normans in their pirate days. The spot was seized on
for defence. A castle arose on the side of the hill, with
a town at its foot sloping swiftly down to the river.
There a bridge of some antiquity joins the right bank to
a central island, which is joined again to the left bank
by another bridge. The island, once strongly fortified,
still keeps the significant name of the Fort. The bridge
which joins the island to the left bank of the river, where
lies the suburb known as <span class="place" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Mureaux</span>, was, at least in
later times, defended by a tower bearing the name of <span class="place" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Sangle</span>. A considerable extent of the outer walls of the
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
castle may be traced, and a specially diligent inquirer
may thread his way to a small fragment of the castle
itself, and may there mark work of a somewhat later date
than the time with which we have to do. It is more
easy to trace out a large part of the defences of the Fort,
and to mark the churches, surviving and desecrated, one
of which, high on the hill side, also belongs, like so many
others, to the age next following. As in so many other
places, so at Meulan, we cannot lay our hand on anything
which we can positively affirm to be the work of its
most famous lord. But we can well see that the strength
of the spot, a spot which in later times played no small
part in the wars of the League, was well understood
in the days of our story, and that so important a position
was strengthened by all the art of the time. When
Count Robert received the forces of Normandy and England
on the height and in the island of Meulan, he did
indeed open a way for those forces into the heart of
France. It was a way which might have been expected
to lead them straight to the city which then, as ever,
might be deemed to be more than the heart of France,
to be France itself.</p>

<p><span class="sni">William’s prospects.</span>
Count Robert was doubtless guided, then and always,
by policy. Many of his neighbours who found themselves
in the like case followed his lead. They could
not serve two masters; so they made up their minds to
serve the master who was strongest either to reward or
to punish, him whose purse was the deeper and whose
spirit was the fiercer.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_461" id="fnanchor_461"></a><a href="#footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></span>
Altogether the odds seemed
frightfully against the French side. Rufus might indeed
have small chances of carrying out his grand scheme of
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
uniting Paris&mdash;&#8203;perhaps Poitiers and Bourdeaux&mdash;&#8203;under
the same lord as Winchester and Rouen; but things at
least looked as if the conquest of the disputed lands was
about to advance the Norman frontier most dangerously
near to the French capital. Above all, when the Seine
was barred both at Roche Guyon and at Meulan, we ask
how things stood in the border town which lay between
them, the town which was one of the special subjects of
William’s demands on Philip. How fared it at Mantes
when the stream both above and below was in the hands
of the enemy? To this question we get no answer; but
we see that, in any case, the King of the French was
more closely shut up than ever in the central prison-house
of his nominal realm.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Failure of William’s plans.</span>
But, small as seemed young Lewis’s means of defence,
weakened as he further was by treason among his own
or his father’s vassals, the resistance made by the French
to the Norman or English invasion was valiant, stubborn,
and, we may add, successful. William Rufus was much
further from conquering France than Henry the Fifth,
or even than Edward the Third, was in after times. With
all his wealth, all his forces, he could not conquer the
land; he could not even take the fortresses to which he
specially laid claim. He could not conquer the Vexin;
he could not take either Pontoise or Chaumont. <span class="sni">Pontoise and Chaumont not taken.</span>
While
we hear nothing of Mantes, we know that both these two
last-named fortresses successfully withstood his attacks.
Of the three fortresses which were the special objects of
the war, one, that of Chaumont, became in some sort its
centre. <span class="sni">Castle of Chaumont.</span>
The Chaumont with which we have to deal is
still distinguished from other places of the same name
as Chaumont-<em>en-Vexin</em>. It stands about five miles east
of the Epte, at the point where the frontier stream of
Rolf is joined by the smaller stream of the Troesne, and
makes a marked turn in its course from nearly due south
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
to south-west. The region is a hilly one, though it contains
no heights of any remarkable elevation. The Bald
Mount itself, which&mdash;&#8203;unluckily for the inquirer&mdash;&#8203;is bald
no longer, is a wide-spreading hill crowned with a mound
which stands out prominently to the eye on every side.
The line of the wall which it supported may still be
easily traced, and in a few places it is actually standing.
On the steep north-eastern side of the hill the small
town of Chaumont nestles at its foot, while the stately
church of the later days of French architecture soars
above the town as the castle again soars above the church.
Of the part played in the war by this stronghold we
shall hear a little later.</p>

<p>The height of Chaumont commands a vast prospect on
all sides; the eye stretches far away over the friendly
land to the south, towards the hills bordering on the
Seine; but the special rival of Chaumont, the fortress
at the junction of the Epte and Troesne, is shut out
from sight by a near range of hills which follow the
line of the smaller stream. Where the two rivers join,
the Epte, like the greater Seine, divides to form a group
of islands at the foot of a low hill on the right, the
Norman, bank. <span class="sni">The castle of Gisors.</span>
Here stands the town and fortress of
Gisors, the chief bulwark of Normandy towards the
north-eastern corner of the Vexin. Once a dependency
of the neighbouring Neauflé, whose mound and square
tower form a prominent object in the landscape, Gisors
had now become a stronghold indeed. <span class="sni">Its first defences. 1096.</span>
It had been
first fenced in about two years before by Pagan of
Gisors, a man of whom we shall hear in the course of
the war.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_462" id="fnanchor_462"></a><a href="#footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></span>
Somewhat later William gave orders that
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>
the border post should be made into a fortress of the
greatest possible strength, and he committed the work
to the most skilful engineer at his command. <span class="sni">Strengthened by Robert of Bellême.</span>
All the
craft and subtlety of the Devil of Bellême were employed
to make Gisors a stronghold which might shelter
the eastern frontier of Normandy against all enemies.
As far as one can see, the islands in the Epte and the
hill which rises above them near to the right bank of
the main river were united in one common plan of
defence. The town itself, taking in the islands, was
walled, either now or at a later time, and defended with
a ditch throughout those parts of its circuit which were
neither sheltered by the river nor by the castle hill. In
the great defences of this last we see the fruit of the
engineering skill of Robert of Bellême, and we better
learn what in those days was deemed a specially strong
fortress. On all sides save that where town and castle
join, the hill is girded by a deep ditch, and on the north,
the side which lies away from both town and river, the
ditch is doubled, and the chief entrance on this side is
defended by an outpost between the two. The ditch
fences in a vast walled space, in the middle of which art
has improved nature by piling up a vast artificial mound
crowned by a shell keep. The earthworks are most likely
older than either Robert of Bellême or Pagan of Gisors.
The outer wall and the shell keep may well be part of
Robert’s design, if they are not actually his work; but the
towers which now rise so proudly over Gisors, not only
the round tower, precious in local legend, but the vast
octagon on one side of the keep which bears the name
of the martyr of Canterbury, must all be of later date
than our time. A graceful chapel within the keep,
where the visitor is told with special emphasis that
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
Saint Thomas once said mass, has thus much to show
in favour of the legend that it is clearly a work of
Henry the Second’s days. <span class="sni">Gisors under Henry the Second.</span>
His days were stirring days
at Gisors as well as the days of Rufus, and a hundred
years of sieges had brought new improvements into the
art of fortification.
All in short that strikes the eye
as the traveller draws near to Gisors, <span class="sni">Present appearance of Gisors.</span>
the castle towers,
no less than the strange and striking outline of one of
the stateliest of those churches which boasted no bishop
or abbot at their head, belongs to later days than those
of the Red King’s campaign of Chaumont. Of the defences
of the town below little can now be traced, and
that part of the defences of the castle on which the
historian looks with the deepest interest is carefully
hidden from distant view. The tower of Saint Thomas
and its lower fellow both seem to rise from the midst of
a wood&mdash;&#8203;a wood artificially planted, seemingly for the
express purpose of robbing Gisors of its characteristic
feature, of shutting out from sight the mighty <dfn>motte</dfn> and
keep which Robert of Bellême made ready at the Red
King’s bidding to be the strongest bulwark of the Norman
land.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Castle of Trye.</span>
Near as Gisors stands to Chaumont, another fortress
barred the way between them. The road between the
two towns passes through Trye&mdash;&#8203;distinguished from its
neighbour Trye-<em>la-Ville</em> as Trye-<em>Château</em>&mdash;which appears
in our story along with Chaumont as one of the French
fortresses which Gisors was specially meant to keep in
check. Yet Trye must have been itself specially meant
as an outpost against Gisors. Close by Gisors is one
of the points where the Norman frontier overlaps
the Epte; so that Trye, lying between two and three
miles from Gisors, is yet nearer than Gisors to the actual
frontier. Trye does not lie, like Chaumont, hidden behind
the hills; it stands boldly in the teeth of the enemy,
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
clearly seen from the hill of Gisors, and barring the main
road between Gisors and Chaumont, a road which led
over level ground and neither over hill nor swamp.
Otherwise the site has not, like Gisors and Chaumont,
any marked advantages of ground, nor, at present at
least, are any earthworks visible. In our time, though a
gate and a tower of later date than our story recall the
days of the military importance of Trye, the attractions
of the spot are chiefly of other kinds. <span class="sni">Primæval and later antiquities.</span>
Between
Trye and Chaumont a cromlech, known as the Three
Stones, calls up the thought of days and men which
were as mysterious in the time of Rufus as they are
now. More than one fragment of mediæval architecture
may be lighted on by the way, and Trye itself stands
conspicuous for the singular and beautiful Romanesque
work&mdash;&#8203;again too late for our immediate time&mdash;&#8203;to be
found both in its ecclesiastical and its secular buildings.</p>

<p>Chaumont and Trye may practically be looked on as
one piece of defence. <span class="sni">Castle of Boury.</span>
A third fortress, that of Boury,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_463" id="fnanchor_463"></a><a href="#footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></span>
lay further apart to the south-west, hidden from Gisors,
like Chaumont, by another line of hills. All three
castles seem to have remained unsubdued through the
whole war. The valour of the French resistance is
dwelled on with pleasure by our Norman or English
guide. Did the monk of Saint Evroul, the young
scholar of the Severn side, remember that, after all,
his father belonged neither to the land of his birth nor
to the land of his adoption, but was in truth a Frenchman
from Orleans?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_464" id="fnanchor_464"></a><a href="#footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></span>
<span class="sni">National feeling in the French Vexin.</span>
The French Vexin was inhabited by
a valiant race, in whom, if we are not pressing too far the
words of our story, a distinct feeling of French nationality
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
was strong. They were ready to run all risks&mdash;&#8203;it is
not said for their King, but for the defence of their
country, for the glory of their nation, for the honour of
the French name.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_465" id="fnanchor_465"></a><a href="#footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></span>
Valiant men, mercenaries it would
seem&mdash;&#8203;but who was to pay them?--from all parts of
Gaul, or at least of France, pressed to their help, and a
brave and successful defence was made. <span class="sni">Prisoners on both sides.</span>
Prisoners on
both sides underwent the two different fates which were
already spoken of. The name on the Norman side
which is best known to us is that of the fierce Gilbert
of Laigle; <span class="sni">Gilbert of Laigle.</span>
with him we hear of the former lord and
fortifier of Gisors.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_466" id="fnanchor_466"></a><a href="#footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></span>
Among the captives on the French
side the national historian records one who bore a far
loftier name, but one which at that moment was hardly
a name of honour. <span class="sni">Simon of Montfort.</span>
Two of the long line of Simons of
the French Montfort are heard of in the course of our
story, father and son, father and brother of her who in
<a name="line190_9" id="line190_9"></a>our authorities appears commonly as the woman from
Anjou, but who on the Strong Mount of her fathers may
have been deemed a Queen of the French. One Simon
is now spoken of as a prisoner; both are found somewhat
later fighting stoutly in the cause of France. We
have heard that the Red King let none free who would

a forefather of our own deliverer had learned the lesson
of Harold, that an extorted oath is of no strength?</p>

§ 2. <span class="title">The First War of Maine.</span><br />
1098.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Dates of the French war. November, 1097&ndash;September, 1098.</span>
These events on the French side, of which thus far we
have but a vague account, would seem to have happened
during the first half of the year with which we are
dealing. But all that we can say for certain is that
they happened between the November of one year and
the September of the next.
Of the struggle which was
going on at the same time in Maine, the dates are far
more clear. <span class="sni">War of Maine. January&mdash;&#8203;August, 1098.</span> It began in January and it was deemed to
be over in August. But its immediate occasion arose
the year before, and its general causes go much further
back. Fully to understand the war of William and
Helias, more truly the war of Helias and Robert of
Bellême, we must trace out the events of several years.
<span class="sni">History of Maine. 1089&ndash;1098.</span>
While we have been following the fates of England,
Normandy, Scotland, and Wales, much of high interest
has been going on in Maine which had no connexion
with the affairs of any part of Britain, and which had
but little influence on Norman affairs either. But now
that England and Normandy have again a common
ruler, the affairs of England, or at least the affairs of
her King, have again a close connexion with the affairs
of Maine. We have now therefore to take up the tale
of that noble city and county from the days when we
had to tell of Duke Robert’s campaign before Ballon
and Saint Cenery.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_467" id="fnanchor_467"></a><a href="#footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Robert suspects the loyalty of Maine. 1089.</span>
The submission of Maine to the Norman Duke which
then took place lasted only till the next favourable
opportunity for asserting the old independence of the
city and county. No great time after he had taken
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
possession, Robert began to suspect the loyalty of his
Cenomannian subjects. A strange story follows, which
connects itself in a way yet stranger with the tale of the
royal household of France which we have lately been
telling. Robert, it seems, was sick at the moment when
he, or some one else for him, thought it needful to take
action against impending revolt in Maine. <span class="sni">He asks help of Fulk of Anjou.</span>
He sent
messengers and gifts to Count Fulk of Anjou, the famous
<span class="title">Rechin</span>, praying him to come to him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_468" id="fnanchor_468"></a><a href="#footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></span>
Fulk, it will
be remembered, claimed the over-lordship of Maine,
and Robert himself had, long before, at the peace of
Blanchelande, done a formal homage to Fulk for the
county.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_469" id="fnanchor_469"></a><a href="#footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></span>
The Angevin Count was supposed to have influence
with the people of Maine, influence which might
be enough to hinder them from revolting. That influence
Robert now prayed Fulk to use. The Angevin
agreed on one condition, namely that the Norman would
use his own influence in quite another quarter, for quite
another purpose. <span class="sni">Fulk asks for Bertrada of Montfort.</span>
Fulk wanted a wife. As the story is
told us, he is said to have had two living wives already;
but that seems not to have been the case.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_470" id="fnanchor_470"></a><a href="#footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></span>
His first wife,
the daughter of a lord of Beaugency, died, leaving a
daughter. He then married Ermengarde of Bourbon&mdash;&#8203;a
description not to become royal for some ages&mdash;&#8203;the
mother of his son Geoffrey Martel. Her he put away
on the usual plea of kindred, and now it was that he
appeared as the wooer of that Bertrada of whom we
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
have already spoken of in her later character. The
daughter of Simon of Montfort was the niece of Count
William of Evreux, through her mother Agnes, Count
William’s sister. <span class="sni">Bertrada brought up by Heloise.</span>
Her mother would seem to have been
dead, and she was brought up in her uncle’s house,
under the schooling of Countess Heloise.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_471" id="fnanchor_471"></a><a href="#footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></span>
The Count of
Anjou, no longer young, driven to strange devices as to his
shoes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_472" id="fnanchor_472"></a><a href="#footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></span>
and burthened with a former wife whose divorce
might be called in question, felt that he was hardly
likely to win favour as a lover in the eyes either of
Bertrada herself or of her guardians. But the <span class="title">Rechin</span> was
skilful at a bargain. He would engage to keep Maine
in the Duke’s obedience, if the Duke would get him the
damsel of Montfort to wife.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_473" id="fnanchor_473"></a><a href="#footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></span>
Robert set off for Evreux
in person, and pleaded Fulk’s cause with Count William.
The Count of Evreux was duly shocked, and set forth
the obvious objections to the marriage. <span class="sni">William of Evreux’s bargain about his niece.</span>
But he too was
open to a bargain; he would get over his scruples if the
Duke would restore to him certain lordships to which he
asserted a right, and would grant certain others to his
nephew William of Breteuil. These lands had been the
possession of his uncle Ralph of Wacey, guardian of
the Great William in his early days, who it seems was
sportively known as Ralph with the Ass’s Head.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_474" id="fnanchor_474"></a><a href="#footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></span>
Let
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
the Duke give him and his nephew back their own,
and Bertrada should be, as far as the Count of Evreux
was concerned, Countess of Anjou.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Robert consents.</span>
The Duke did not venture to answer without the
advice of his counsellors. <span class="sni">His counsellors.</span>
But the combined wisdom of
Robert of Bellême, lately a rebel but now again in
favour,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_475" id="fnanchor_475"></a><a href="#footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></span>
of the Ætheling Eadgar, and of that monastic
William of Arques of whom we have already heard,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_476" id="fnanchor_476"></a><a href="#footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></span>
advised the acceptance of Count William’s terms. The
whole county of Maine was of more value than the
lordships which the Count of Evreux demanded as the
price of his niece.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_477" id="fnanchor_477"></a><a href="#footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></span>
The power and the will of Fulk to
do what he promised about Le Mans and Maine seems
not to have been doubted. The double bargain was
struck, and it was carried out for a season. Count
William and his nephew got all that they asked, except
that one lordship passed to Gerard of Gournay. <span class="sni">Fulk marries Bertrada.</span>
Fulk
too got what he asked, namely Bertrada, till such time
as King Philip took her away. She had time to quarrel
with her stepson Geoffrey, and to become the mother of
Fulk, afterwards Count of Anjou and King of Jerusalem,
and grandfather of the first Angevin King of England.
<span class="sni">Maine kept quiet for a year.</span>
And Count Fulk was able, by whatever means, to keep
the Cenomannian city and county in a formal allegiance
to the Norman Duke, till such time as the temptations
to revolt became too strong to be withstood.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Movements in Maine.</span>
Our story however seems to imply that the submission
of Maine to Robert was wholly on the surface, and that
all this while schemes were going on for shaking off the
hated Norman yoke. The present movement took the
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
same form which had been taken by the movement in the
Conqueror’s day.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_478" id="fnanchor_478"></a><a href="#footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></span>
The avowed object of Cenomannian
patriotism was now, as then, the restoration of the ancient
dynasty. The valour and energy of the citizens of Le
Mans are constantly spoken of; but we hear nothing this
time of the <dfn>commune</dfn>. The rule of some prince seems to
be assumed on all hands, and for a while all seem to have
agreed in seeking that prince in the same quarter in
which they had sought a prince already. <span class="sni">Hugh son of Azo sent for. 1090.</span>
Little indeed
of good for Le Mans or Maine had come of the former
application to Azo and Gersendis; but their son Hugh
had now reached greater years and experience, and the
men of Maine again sent into Italy to ask for him to
reign over them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_479" id="fnanchor_479"></a><a href="#footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Union of Geoffrey and Helias.</span>
The application was supported both
by Geoffrey of Mayenne, of whom we have so often heard
during the last thirty years, and by Helias of La Flèche,
who might well have asserted his own claims against
those of the distant house of Este.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_480" id="fnanchor_480"></a><a href="#footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Helias of La Flèche.</span>
Helias now becomes the hero of the Cenomannian
tale. He is one of the men of his time of whom we can
get the clearest idea. We see him alike in his recorded
acts and in his elaborately drawn portrait; and by the
light of the two we can hail in him the very noblest type
of the age and class to which he belonged. We see in
him a no less worthy defender of the freedom of Maine
than Harold was of the freedom of England. <span class="sni">His character</span>
He stands
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
before us with his tall stature, his strong, thin, and well-proportioned
frame, his swarthy complexion, his thick
hair cropped close after Norman or priestly fashion.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_481" id="fnanchor_481"></a><a href="#footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></span>
Brave and skilful in war, wise and just in his rule in
peace, ready and pleasant in speech, gentle to the good
and stern to the evil, faithful to his word, and corrupted
neither by good nor evil fortune, a man withal of prayer
and fasting, the bountiful friend of the Church and the
poor, Helias stands forth within the narrow range of a
single county of Gaul as one who, on a wider field, might
have won for himself a place among the foremost of mankind.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_482" id="fnanchor_482"></a><a href="#footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></span>
With the house of the old Counts of Maine he had
a twofold connexion. <span class="sni">and descent.</span>
The male line of Herbert Wake-dog
had come to an end; but in the female line Helias came
of it in two descents, while Hugh came in one only. Not
only was his mother Paula one of the sisters of the
younger Herbert, but his father John of La Flèche was
son of a daughter of Wake-dog himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_483" id="fnanchor_483"></a><a href="#footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His castles.</span>
To his father’s
Angevin fief of La Flèche, among the islands of the Loir,
his marriage with Matilda, a grand-niece of Archbishop
Gervase of Rheims, known to us better as Bishop of
Le Mans,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_484" id="fnanchor_484"></a><a href="#footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></span>
had added a string of castles in the south of
Maine. Two of these, Mayet and the one which is
specially called the Castle of the Loir, fill a prominent
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
place in our story.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_485" id="fnanchor_485"></a><a href="#footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></span>
Helias was plainly the greatest lord
of eastern Maine, the modern department of Sarthe, as
Geoffrey of Mayenne was the greatest in western Maine,
the modern department which still bears the name of his
own fortress.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_486" id="fnanchor_486"></a><a href="#footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His possible claim on the county.</span>
One might have thought that the position
of Helias as a great local chief might, when the
elders of Maine were called on to choose a prince, have
outweighed any slight genealogical precedence on the
part of the stranger Hugh. But the great men of the
county may not have been disposed to place one of themselves
over their own heads. <span class="sni">He accepts the succession of Hugh.</span>
Anyhow Helias, like his
father before him,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_487" id="fnanchor_487"></a><a href="#footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></span>
waived his own claim to the succession.
Along with the lord of Mayenne and the great mass of
the people of the city and county, he welcomed the Ligurian
prince&mdash;&#8203;such is the geography of our chief guide&mdash;&#8203;when
he came to take possession of the dominion to
which the voice of the Cenomannian people had called
him a second time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_488" id="fnanchor_488"></a><a href="#footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Negotiations with Hugh.</span>
We are to suppose that the negotiations with the
house of Este were going on during the year when Count
Fulk contrived to keep Maine outwardly quiet. But
when the quarrel between William and Robert broke
out, when Normandy was divided and dismembered, the
Angevin over-lord’s influence gave way. The time for
action was clearly come. <span class="sni">Revolt of Maine. 1090.</span>
Le Mans and all Maine now
openly rose against the Norman dominion. Duke
Robert’s garrisons were driven out;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_489" id="fnanchor_489"></a><a href="#footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></span>
the Cenomannian
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">198</span>
land was again free. <span class="sni">Invitation to Hugh.</span>
But the first act of restored freedom
was to invite Hugh of Este, descendant of the ancient
counts, to come at once to take possession, and to rule in
the palace on the Roman wall which fences in the Cenomannian
hill.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Opposition of Bishop Howel.</span>
The chief opponent of the movement for independence
was, as before, the Bishop. The throne of Saint Julian
was still filled by the Breton Howel, the nominee of
the Conqueror, and he stood firm in his loyalty to
his patron’s eldest son.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_490" id="fnanchor_490"></a><a href="#footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></span>
He withstood the revolt by
every means in his power, and scattered interdicts and
anathemas against the supporters of the newly-elected
Count.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_491" id="fnanchor_491"></a><a href="#footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></span>
Hugh had not yet come, and the opposition of
the Bishop was felt to be dangerous. <span class="sni">Howel imprisoned by Helias.</span>
Helias therefore,
whose piety did not lead him to any superstitious reverence
for ecclesiastical privileges, dealt with Howel as an
enemy, or at least as one whom it was well to keep out
of the way for a season. As the Bishop was going
through his diocese with a train of clergy, in the discharge
of some episcopal duty, Helias seized him, carried
him off, and put him in ward at La Flèche.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_492" id="fnanchor_492"></a><a href="#footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></span>
The great
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
grievance seems to have been that Howel was denied
the company of his attendant clergy, and was allowed
the services only of one unlettered rustic priest. The
fear was lest the Bishop and his more learned companions
would, in their Latin talk, plot something which
their keepers would not understand.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_493" id="fnanchor_493"></a><a href="#footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></span>
This very complaint
shows that the Bishop’s imprisonment was
not of a very harsh kind. But the cause of the captive
prelate was zealously taken up by his clergy. <span class="sni">Interdict of Le Mans.</span>
Le
Mans and its suburbs were put under a practical interdict;
divine worship ceased; the bells were silent; the
doors of the churches were stopped up with thorns.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_494" id="fnanchor_494"></a><a href="#footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></span>
Great, it is said, was the joy when the Bishop was set
free and came back to his city. <span class="sni">Liberation of Howel on Hugh’s coming.</span>
We are told by a writer
in the episcopal interest that Helias set him free in a fit
of penitence, in answer to many intercessions from
nobles, clergy, and neighbouring bishops. Howel was
gracious and forgiving, and let his wrongs be forgotten
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
on the restoration of whatever had been taken from
him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_495" id="fnanchor_495"></a><a href="#footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></span>
All this is possible; but the more definite statement
that Howel was kept in ward till Hugh came
shows that his captivity was a matter of policy, and that
he was set free as soon as it seemed that no object could
be gained by prolonging it.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Hugh reaches Le Mans.</span>
Meanwhile Hugh was on the road. At the border
fortress of La Chartre he was met by the magistrates of
Le Mans&mdash;&#8203;the city seems, as often in Cenomannian history,
to act for the whole county&mdash;&#8203;who swore oaths to
him, counting, it is added, their former oaths to Duke Robert
for nought.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_496" id="fnanchor_496"></a><a href="#footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Howel flees to Robert.</span>
The Bishop, determined not to acknowledge
the revolution, fled to the court of the prince
whom he did acknowledge. But he found little help
there. <span class="sni">Robert’s carelessness as to his loss.</span>
The idle and luxurious Robert seemed not to
care, he seemed almost to rejoice, that so noble a part
of his dominions had fallen away from him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_497" id="fnanchor_497"></a><a href="#footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></span>
One thing
only he would not give up; he would at all hazards cleave
to his rights over the Cenomannian bishopric.<span class="sni">He cleaves to his rights over the bishopric.</span>
Robert
bade Howel to go back to Le Mans, but to do nothing
which could be taken as an admission of Hugh as temporal
lord of the bishopric.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_498" id="fnanchor_498"></a><a href="#footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></span>
Howel went home, and
found the new Count, for whatever reason, quartered in
the episcopal palace. He had himself to live in the
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
abbey of Saint Vincent, just outside the city. <span class="sni">Dispute between Hugh and Howel.</span>
A long
dispute followed between the Breton Bishop and the
Italian Count, and then came a still fiercer dispute between
the Bishop and a party in his own Chapter. One
or two points are of constitutional interest, and remind
us of questions which we have just before heard of in
our own land. <span class="sni">Howel refuses to acknowledge Hugh as <span class="title">advocatus</span>.</span>
The Count called on Howel to acknowledge
himself as his feudal superior for the temporalities
of the bishopric.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_499" id="fnanchor_499"></a><a href="#footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></span>
He refused and left the city, on
which Hugh seized the temporalities of the bishopric.
<span class="sni">Howel and his Chapter.</span>
Worse even than the Count were the Bishop’s clerical
enemies, one Hilgot at their head. By a cruel subtlety
they had persuaded him to appoint as Dean a mere boy
from his own land, Geoffrey by name, of the age of
twelve years only&mdash;&#8203;so it is said. <span class="sni">Disputes about the deanery.</span>
Now they turned about,
found fault with the appointment, and set up an anti-dean
of their own.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_500" id="fnanchor_500"></a><a href="#footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></span>
The Bishop crossed over to England
for help, and, strange to say, he found a friend in the
King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_501" id="fnanchor_501"></a><a href="#footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Howel comes to England.</span>
But meanwhile all kinds of wrongs were done to

his people, even to branding an innocent boy in the
face.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_502" id="fnanchor_502"></a><a href="#footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></span>
At last a reconciliation between the Count and
the Bishop was brought about, partly because of the
turn taken by public feeling. Saint Julian’s, in the
absence of its chief pastor, was forsaken, while crowds
flocked to keep the feasts of the Church at the Bishop’s
monastic retreat. This was at the priory of Solêmes,
near Sablé, lying south-west of the city, towards the
Angevin border.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_503" id="fnanchor_503"></a><a href="#footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Return of Howel. June 28, 1090.</span>

<p><span class="sni">Unpopularity of Hugh.</span>
But happier days were to come for the Bishop and the
people of Maine. It was not only to Howel and his
clergy that the Italian Count had made himself hateful.
He had none of the qualities which were needed in the
ruler of a high-spirited people in a time of danger. Idle,
timid, weak of purpose, he had no power among the
men over whom he was set; and he had not, as seems
to have been hoped for, brought with him any store of
money from the south.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_505" id="fnanchor_505"></a><a href="#footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></span>
His wife, a daughter of Robert
Wiscard, a woman of a lofty spirit, was too much for him.
He put her away, and was excommunicated by Pope
Urban for so doing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_506" id="fnanchor_506"></a><a href="#footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></span>
Despised of all men, he was thinking

<span class="sni">February, 1091.</span>
It was now moreover the moment when
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
the Norman power had again become specially dangerous
to Maine. <span class="sni">Danger of Maine.</span>
The sons of the great William, lately at
variance, were now reconciled, and the subjugation of
Maine was one of the terms of their agreement.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_508" id="fnanchor_508"></a><a href="#footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></span>
Helias
saw his opportunity. He set forth the dangers of the
land to his cousin. Hugh said that he wished to sell
his county and be off.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_509" id="fnanchor_509"></a><a href="#footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></span>
Helias argued that, in that
case, he ought to sell it to no one but himself. He set
forth his right by birth; he said that it was no easy
place that he was seeking. But his just rights and a
love for the freedom of the land called him to it, and he
trusted that God would help him in his post of danger.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_510" id="fnanchor_510"></a><a href="#footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></span>
A bargain was soon struck. <span class="sni">Helias buys the county.</span>
For a sum of ten thousand
Cenomannian shillings Hugh agreed to abdicate in
favour of his cousin. The coronet of Maine passed from
the son of Gersendis to the son of Paula. Hugh went

without opposition as Count of Maine.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_511" id="fnanchor_511"></a><a href="#footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">First reign of Helias. 1091&ndash;1098.</span>
The reign of Helias over Le Mans and Maine lasted
for about twenty years, with a break of three years
of warfare of which we shall presently have to speak.
First came a time of seven or eight years, during which
the Cenomannian people might indeed be objects of envy
to the people either of Normandy or of England. The new
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">204</span>
prince, by every account of his actions, showed himself
the model of a ruler of those times. <span class="sni">His strong and just rule.</span>
He did justice and
made peace; as far as a prince of those days could do
so, he sheltered the weak from the oppressions of the
strong.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_512" id="fnanchor_512"></a><a href="#footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></span>
His personal piety was not lessened, nor was his
devotion to the Church less zealous, now that the ecclesiastical
power was no longer a political enemy. <span class="sni">His friendship for Howel.</span>
Strong
in the friendship of his late gaoler, Bishop Howel could
rule his diocese in peace, and could carry on his works
of building, both in the city itself and in his neighbouring
lordship of Coulaines.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_513" id="fnanchor_513"></a><a href="#footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Peace of the land.</span>
And these happy years were
years of peace without as well as within. The rule of
Helias was undisputed; Maine saw neither revolt within
her own borders nor invasion from any power beyond
them. Whatever designs either Robert or William may
have cherished against the independence of Maine, those
designs did not for the present take the shape of
any overt act. Robert seems to have done absolutely
nothing; the first signs of impending evil showed themselves
soon after William’s acquisition of Normandy; <span class="sni">1096.</span>
but
there was no open warfare for two years longer.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Translation of Saint Julian. October 17, 1093.</span>
In these times of exceptional quiet there is little to
record beyond ecclesiastical ceremonies. It was a bright
day at Le Mans when Bishop Howel was able to translate
the body of the venerated patron of the city to the
place of honour in his new building.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_514" id="fnanchor_514"></a><a href="#footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></span>
That was the
time when Anselm, already enthroned, was waiting for
consecration, and when Malcolm had turned away from
Gloucester to plan his last invasion of Northumberland.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_515" id="fnanchor_515"></a><a href="#footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></span>
<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
In these years too Howel must have finished the two
stately towers of Saint Julian’s minster, of which we shall
before long have a tale to tell. But Le Mans presently
saw a greater day than all, as it seemed at least in
the eyes of the biographer of her bishops. <span class="sni">Visit of Pope Urban to Le Mans. November or December, 1095.</span>
After the
days of Piacenza and Clermont, Pope Urban honoured
the Cenomannian city with his presence. For three
days the sovereign Pontiff was the guest of Howel, and
we are told that, though it was a year of scarceness,
yet the Bishop of Le Mans was able to entertain the
Pope and his following right bountifully.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_516" id="fnanchor_516"></a><a href="#footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></span>
Howel, it is
said, appeared among his fellow-bishops conspicuous
for the gifts of both mind and body. Men rejoiced with
him on the happiness of receiving such a guest, and
deemed from his health and vigour that he might long
enjoy his honours.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_517" id="fnanchor_517"></a><a href="#footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Sickness of Howel. 1095&ndash;1097.</span>
Before long he fell sick, and his
sickness was unto death, although his end did not come
till nearly two years after the preaching at Clermont.
The visit of Urban, the death of Howel, led to important
events in the history of Maine.</p>

<p>The preaching of the crusade, above all the presence,
and doubtless the preaching, of the crusading Pope in
his own city, stirred up the same impulse in the heart
of Helias which was stirred up in the hearts of so many
other men of his day. <span class="sni">Helias takes the cross. 1095&ndash;1096.</span>
Young and strong, devout and
valiant, he would go and fight to win back the sepulchre
of his Lord from the misbelievers and to deliver his
Christian brethren in other lands from their cruel bondage.
By the counsel of the Pope, the Count of Maine
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
took the cross, and made ready to go on the armed
pilgrimage along with his neighbours, with Robert
of Normandy and Stephen of Chartres.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_518" id="fnanchor_518"></a><a href="#footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Estimate of his action.</span>
Our feeling
perhaps is that Helias, like Saint Lewis, had a stronger
call to stay at home than to go on the crusade. A certain
part of mankind, a small part certainly, but that
part among which his immediate duty lay, was peaceful
and happy under his rule as they were not likely to be
under the rule of any other. Could it be right, we might
argue, for him to leave a work which none could do but
himself, a work which he had taken on his shoulders of
his own free will, for another work, however noble,
which others could do as well as himself? Let Robert
go and win honour abroad instead of dishonour at home.
Normandy was in such a case that the coming even of
Rufus was a happy change. Let Stephen of Chartres
go; he left his royal-hearted Adela behind him. Let
King Philip go, if he could go; his son Lewis would rule
his realm far better than he. But let Helias stay, and
keep for his land and city that well-being which he
had given and which another might take away. <span class="sni">Sigurd and Eystein.</span>
An
argument nearly the same as this was actually pressed
on the crusading Sigurd by his stay-at-home brother
Eystein. While Sigurd was warring far away, Eystein
had done a great deal of good to his own people in
Norway.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_519" id="fnanchor_519"></a><a href="#footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></span>
But there are moments in the world’s history,
moments when all has to be sacrificed to a great
cause, when arguments like these, so sound against
ordinary warfare, sound above all against the utterly
purposeless warfare of those days, cannot be listened
to. <span class="sni">Argument in favour of the Crusade.</span>
If Western Christendom was to arm for a crusade,
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>
it was well that that crusade should be headed by the
noblest men in Western Christendom. The work would
not be done, if it were only left to lower souls. If
Godfrey was to march, it was fit that Helias should march
beside him. Godfrey went; Helias did not go. He had
now a neighbour who made it vain for him to think of
leaving his own land in jeopardy, even to carry out his
promise to Pope Urban and to go on the holy war.</p>

<p><span class="sni">William in Normandy. August (?), 1096.</span>
The bargain between William and Robert had just been
struck. The two brothers were together at Rouen. Robert
was about to set out for Jerusalem; William had come to
take possession of Normandy. It would have been the
height of rashness for Helias to join in the enterprise of
Robert, unless he could make his county safe during his
absence against any aggression on the part of William.
<span class="sni">Danger to Maine.</span>
According to Norman doctrines, Maine was simply a rebellious
province. Robert had done nothing to stop the
rebellion, but he had never acknowledged either Hugh or
Helias as lawful Prince of the Cenomannians. Where
Robert had done nothing, William would be likely to act
with vigour. The claims which Robert had simply not
acknowledged William might be inclined to dispute
with the sword. <span class="sni">Importance of Norman neutrality.</span>
It was therefore of the utmost moment
for the Count of Maine to secure the friendship,
or at least the neutrality, of the new ruler of Normandy.
Helias doubtless knew that, if William bound himself
by his knightly promise, that promise would be faithfully
kept, and he perhaps hoped that towards one who
was bound on a holy errand, an errand during which he
would be harmless and powerless as far as Maine and
Normandy were concerned, the chivalrous king might be
disposed to pledge such a promise. He therefore went to
Rouen, and sought interviews with both brothers. <span class="sni">Helias and Robert.</span>
He
first took counsel with the Duke.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_520" id="fnanchor_520"></a><a href="#footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Helias and William.</span>
Robert, we know, could
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
give counsel to others,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_521" id="fnanchor_521"></a><a href="#footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></span>
and he had no temptation at
this moment to give unfriendly counsel to Helias. By
his advice, the Count of Maine went to the King; <span class="sni">He professes himself William’s vassal.</span>
he
addressed him reverently, and, if his words be rightly
reported, acknowledged himself his vassal. So to do
was no degradation, and the acknowledgement might
turn the King’s heart towards him. He set forth his
purpose of going to the crusade; he said that he wished
to go as the King’s friend and in his peace.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_522" id="fnanchor_522"></a><a href="#footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Answer of Rufus; he demands the cession of Maine.</span>
Then
Rufus burst forth in a characteristic strain. Helias
may go whither he thinks good; but let him give
up the city and county of Maine; whatever his father
held it was William’s will to hold also.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_523" id="fnanchor_523"></a><a href="#footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></span>
Helias
answers that he holds his county by lawful inheritance
from his forefathers, and that he hopes by God’s help
to hand it on to his children. But if the King has a
mind to try the question in a peaceful pleading, he is
ready to maintain his right before kings, counts, and
bishops, and to abide by their judgement.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_524" id="fnanchor_524"></a><a href="#footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></span>
Rufus tells
him that he will plead against him with swords and
spears and countless arrows.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_525" id="fnanchor_525"></a><a href="#footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Challenge of Helias.</span>
Then Helias spoke his
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
solemn challenge. He had wished to fight against the
heathen in the name of the Lord, but he had found the
enemies of Christ nearer to his own doors. The county
which he held was his by the gift of God;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_526" id="fnanchor_526"></a><a href="#footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></span>
he would
not lightly give it up, nor leave his people to the wolves
as sheep without a shepherd. Let the King and all his
nobles hear. He bore the cross of a pilgrim; that cross
he would not lay aside; he would bear it on his shield,
on his helmet, on the saddle and bridle of his horse.
Under the protection of that sign he would go forth to
defend himself against all who might attack him, that
all might know that those who were fighting against him
were fighting against a warrior of the cross. He trusted
in Him who ruled the world and who knew the secrets
of his heart, that a day would come when he would be
able to discharge his vow according to the letter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_527" id="fnanchor_527"></a><a href="#footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Rufus lets Helias go with a defiance.</span>
The
Red King bade him go whither he would and do
what he would; he had no mind to fight against crusaders,
but he would have the city which his father
had once won.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_528" id="fnanchor_528"></a><a href="#footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></span>
Let Helias get together workmen to
repair his broken walls.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_529" id="fnanchor_529"></a><a href="#footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></span>
He would presently visit the
citizens of Le Mans, and would show himself before their
gates with a hundred thousand pennoned lances.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_530" id="fnanchor_530"></a><a href="#footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></span>
He
would send cars drawn by oxen, and laden with arrows
and javelins. But before the oxen could reach Le
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pageno">210</span>
Mans, he would be there with many legions of armed
men.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_531" id="fnanchor_531"></a><a href="#footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the threatening message which Helias was
bidden to receive as the most certain truth and to go
back and tell his accomplices&mdash;&#8203;that is, we may understand,
his faithful subjects. <span class="sni">Helias makes ready for defence.</span>
He went back to his
capital, and began to put his dominions into a state fit
to withstand an attack. But as yet no attack came;
for a year or more neither king nor legions nor oxen
were seen before the gates of Le Mans. <span class="sni">William delays his attack. 1096&ndash;1097.</span>
William was
busy with many matters, with the dispute with Anselm,
with the Welsh war, with the affairs of Scotland. We
are told, characteristically enough, that in the midst of
all these affairs he forgot Maine altogether. Helias
meanwhile remained in actual possession of the county,
not attacked or disturbed by Rufus, but in no way
acknowledged by him, with the King’s threats hanging
over him, and knowing that an attack might come at
any moment. At last this armed neutrality came to
an end. An event happened which called the King’s
mind back to Cenomannian affairs in a manner specially
characteristic of Cenomannian history.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Affairs of the bishopric.</span>
Again, as so often in our story, the bishopric of
Le Mans becomes the centre of the drama and the
subject of dispute among the princes of the world. <span class="sni">Death of Howel July 29, 1097.</span>
In
the middle of the summer, shortly before the council
of Winchester, Bishop Howel died, seemingly of the
same sickness which had come upon him soon after the
visit of Pope Urban. Helias, like Hugh, deemed himself,
as the reigning Count, to be the temporal lord of
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
the bishopric, and he at once nominated to the vacant
see. <span class="sni">Helias nominates Geoffrey.</span>
His choice was the Dean of Saint Julian’s, that
same Geoffrey who had been placed by Howel in the
deanery in his childhood, and who, if the dates be right,
must still have been wonderfully young for a bishop.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_532" id="fnanchor_532"></a><a href="#footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The canons choose Hildebert.</span>
But the canons of Saint Julian’s stood upon their right
of free election, and chose a man of greater name, their
Chancellor and Archdeacon, the famous Hildebert.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_533" id="fnanchor_533"></a><a href="#footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></span>
They placed him at once, seemingly against his own
will, on the episcopal throne.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_534" id="fnanchor_534"></a><a href="#footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></span>
At first Helias was wroth,
and was minded to set aside this direct slight to his
authority. <span class="sni">Helias accepts the election.</span>
But the rights of the Chapter were set before
him, and, unlike our own Confessor under less provocation,
he yielded, and accepted the election.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_535" id="fnanchor_535"></a><a href="#footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></span>
The

eaten to no purpose.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_536" id="fnanchor_536"></a><a href="#footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Geoffrey Archbishop of Rouen. 1111.</span> His time of promotion was only

Fourteen years later, Geoffrey succeeded William

<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
his now more successful competitor was not fated
always to remain in the second rank of prelacy. <span class="sni">Hildebert Bishop of Le Mans. 1097&ndash;1126.</span>
One
of the great scholars of his day, renowned for his
writings both in prose and verse, a diligent writer of
letters and thereby one of the authorities for our history,
a builder, a reformer, an enemy of heresy who
could yet deal gently with the heretic,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_537" id="fnanchor_537"></a><a href="#footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></span>
a model in
short, we are told, of every episcopal virtue, Hildebert
ruled the church of Le Mans for more than twenty-nine
years, <span class="sni">Archbishop of Tours. 1126&ndash;1134.</span>
and then for the last nine years of his long life
was removed to the metropolitan throne of Tours.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_538" id="fnanchor_538"></a><a href="#footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>All the elements of the Cenomannian state, prince,
clergy, and people, had joined in the elevation of Hildebert.
But there was one to whom any free election or
nomination by any of the local powers was in its own
nature distasteful. <span class="sni">Claims of the Norman Dukes over the bishopric.</span>
It was perhaps because their claim
was very doubtful that the princes of the Norman house
clave with such special obstinacy to their rights over
the temporalities of the see of Le Mans. The bishopric
was the one thing in Maine which even the careless
Robert cared about.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_539" id="fnanchor_539"></a><a href="#footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></span>
And to William Rufus, who so
deeply cherished his father’s memory, it would seem a
crowning indignity that a bishop appointed by his father,
a special and loyal friend of his father, should be succeeded
by any one, whether the choice of count, chapter,
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
or <dfn>commune</dfn>, in whose election he himself had no share.
<span class="sni">Anger of Rufus at the election of Hildebert.</span>
When the King heard of the election of Hildebert, he
was very wroth. He forbade his consecration, seemingly
under threats of open war.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_540" id="fnanchor_540"></a><a href="#footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></span>
Hildebert was consecrated
none the less, and the war which Rufus had hitherto
planned in his heart, broke out in action.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_541" id="fnanchor_541"></a><a href="#footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">William in Normandy. November, 1097.</span>
When William crossed the sea in the November
following the election of Hildebert, we may believe that
the wrong which he held to have been done to him
in the matter of that election was in his mind as a
secondary cause of action, along with his demand of the
Vexin from the King of the French. <span class="sni">His designs on Maine.</span>
He came for war
with France; he was ready for war with Maine also.
But we do not hear of any actual military operations
till the next year had begun. And, when warfare
began, it was at first warfare carried on, just as often
happened in Wales and even in Scotland, by the King’s
licence indeed, but not by the King himself. <span class="sni">Robert of Bellême attacks Maine.</span> The immediate
danger lay on the side of the county which was
threatened by the constant enemy of Maine and of Helias,
Robert of Bellême.
From him came the first acts
of warfare. It was against him that Helias now found
it needful to strengthen his castle of Dangeul.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_542" id="fnanchor_542"></a><a href="#footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Helias strengthens the castle of Dangeul. Its position.</span>
This point lies to the north-east of Ballon, at only a few miles’
distance. The castle stands on a height nearly equal to
that of Ballon, though Dangeul does not take the same
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
marked form of a promontory, but rather stands on the
edge of a wide expanse of high ground sinking by stages
down to the plain below. The fortress has wholly
vanished; but its site may be traced within the grounds
of the modern <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</i> which has taken its place, and
which represents, in a figure, the stronghold of Helias.
The view which the spot commands shows how well the
site was chosen. The eye ranges as far as the height of
Sillé-le-Guillaume on one side, as far as the Norman
Chaumont on the other. Dangeul stood right in the
way of an advance of the arch-enemy, whether from his
own home at Bellême or from any of his Norman or
Cenomannian fortresses.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Geographical character of the war; waged chiefly with Robert of Bellême.</span>
The war of Maine is largely a war between Helias and
Robert of Bellême. This gives the war its special geographical
character. The immediate possessions of Helias
lay in the south-eastern part of the county; the
fortresses of the enemy threatened him from the north-east.
The capital lay between them. The result is that
the seat of war is confined to the eastern part of Maine,
the modern department of Sarthe, and that Le Mans
itself is its special centre. Of western Maine, the modern
department of Mayenne, we hear nothing. There is no
news from the old battle-field of Domfront, Ambrières,
and Mayenne itself, though of the lord of Mayenne we
still continue to hear. There is nothing this time to tell
of Sainte-Susanne or of Sillé-le-Guillaume.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_543" id="fnanchor_543"></a><a href="#footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></span>
The war
takes up such an area as is natural when the strife is
waged mainly for the city of Le Mans, when it is waged
between the lord of La Flèche and the lord of Bellême.
The enemy advances from Alençon and Mamers; he is
checked by the fortification of Dangeul.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Effects of the occupation of Dangeul.</span>
The occupation of this last strong post by Helias was
not without effect. He did not indeed win back any of
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
the castles which were held by Robert of Bellême; but
the garrison of Dangeul kept the invader in check, and
hindered him from carrying his accustomed ravages
through the whole country. This move of Helias seems
even to have convinced Robert that the conquest of
Maine was an undertaking too great for his own unassisted
power. <span class="sni">Robert of Bellême invites the King. January, 1098.</span>
In January he went to the King, and
stirred him up to a direct attack on Helias. With a
lover of warfare like Robert winter went for nothing; it
would be just the time to take the enemy by surprise,
while they were not expecting any attack. The King,
we are told, was unwilling. It is hard to understand
why this should be, unless he was too busily occupied
with the war in the Vexin. He was ashamed however&mdash;&#8203;the
chivalrous feeling again comes in&mdash;&#8203;to shrink from
any warlike enterprise which was proposed to him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_544" id="fnanchor_544"></a><a href="#footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></span>
<span class="sni">William and Robert against Helias.</span>
The King and the Count of Bellême set forth; but they
found the Count of Maine fully their match. He knew
how war was to be carried on in his own land against
an enemy stronger than himself. <span class="sni"><em>Guerrilla</em> warfare of Helias.</span>
He planted detachments
at every convenient post; he lined the hedges and
defences of every kind with men; he guarded the passages
of the streams, and the difficult approaches of the
woods. Against this kind of skirmishing warfare the
mighty Rufus and all his knights were able to do as
little as they were able to do against the light-armed
Welsh.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_545" id="fnanchor_545"></a><a href="#footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></span>

<p><span class="sni">Robert of Bellême continues the war.</span>
Meanwhile Robert of Bellême was left to carry on the
struggle with Helias. He was ordered by Rufus to
bring together as large a force as he could in his own
fortresses, nor did the King forget to supply him with
abundance of money for that purpose.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_546" id="fnanchor_546"></a><a href="#footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></span>
On such a
bidding as this, Robert of Bellême, Robert the Devil on
Cenomannian lips, set to work with a will which fully
bore out his surname. He built new fortresses, he
strengthened the old ones with deep ditches.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_547" id="fnanchor_547"></a><a href="#footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></span>
He had
already occupied nine castles, besides fortified houses,
on Cenomannian ground.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_548" id="fnanchor_548"></a><a href="#footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Castles held by him in Maine.</span>
The list is given as Blèves,
Perray, Mont-de-la-Nue, Saônes, Saint Remy-du-plain,
Lurçon, Allières, Motte de Gauthier-le-Clincamp, and
Mamers. All these lie in the north-eastern part of the
county, the part immediately threatened from Alençon
and Bellême. They occupy nearly the whole of the land
between the Cenomannian Orne and the upper course of
the Sarthe above Alençon, lying on each side, north and
south, of the great forest of Perseigne. The line of the
Sarthe from Alençon to Le Mans remained untouched,
while Ballon stood as the advanced guard of the capital,
and Dangeul was a yet further outpost of Helias, in the
very teeth of the invader from Bellême. Perray, alone
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
among the points held by Robert, stands as far south
as the lower course of the Orne.</p>

<p>Several of the castles on this list occupied marked
sites, and have left considerable traces. Mamers and
Blèves were strictly border fortresses, points which
Robert had seized just within the Cenomannian border;
the others were more advanced points in the heart of
the Cenomannian land. <span class="sni">Mamers.</span>
Mamers, with its streets sloping
down to the young Orne, is the only one of the places on
our list which is now at all a considerable town. But
the only signs of its fortifications which are to be seen
are found in the names of its streets, which suggest the
former presence of a fort by the river and of a castle on
somewhat higher ground. Mamers, due west from Bellême,
may well have been Robert’s first conquest, and its
occupation may have marked his first advance into the
dominions of his neighbour. But he must also, early in
his career, have made himself master of Blèves. <span class="sni">Blèves.</span>
This is
a point which has no natural advantages of height, but
which, standing in the very north-east corner of Maine,
separated from Perche by a small tributary of the Sarthe,
is important from its border position and as commanding
a bridge. A mound which once stood there has been
levelled; a graceful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Renaissance</i> house near its site is
the present representative of the castle; but parts of
the ditches may still be seen; the church, near but not
within the enclosure, contains work which may have
been looked on by Hildebert and Helias, and ancient
masonry still remains at the manorial mill. Blèves
lies north of the forest of Perseigne; <span class="sni">Allières.</span>
at Allières, on
its eastern verge, all actual traces of the castle have
vanished; but the church again contains some small
parts which seem contemporary with our story, and the
site of the fortress may well be marked by the modern
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</i> on the hill-side commanding a wide view to
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
the south. But more speaking witnesses of this war
may be seen at two points lying south of the forest and
directly west of Mamers. <span class="sni">Saint Remy-du-plain.</span>
Saint Remy, distinguished as
Saint Remy <em>du Plain</em> from a namesake to the south-east
known as Saint Remy <em>du Mont</em>, stands, not indeed in
the plain, but on the edge of the high ground. It commands
an extensive view, reaching to the point which
bounds most of the views in northern Maine, the <dfn>butte</dfn>
of Chaumont. <span class="sni">Saônes.</span>
A site of the like kind, but with a less
wide prospect, is held by Saônes at a short distance to
the south, hard by that unusual feature in these lands,
a small lake. Saônes is now a small village, but it
was once of importance enough to give its name to the
surrounding district of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saosnois</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sonnois</i>. In both
these cases the castle-mound rises immediately to the
west of the church, the latter at Saint Remy being a
late building of more pretension than is usual in the
neighbourhood. Each mound has its surrounding ditch,
which at Saint Remy is of most striking depth; each has
its encircling wall; each has its inner tower, that at
Saônes of an irregular four-sided shape, that of Saint
Remy octagonal without and round within. Here are two
unmistakeable and most striking sites of the fortresses
which the invader from Perche rent away from the
Cenomannian county. But, with such small remains of
walls as are still left, it is hard to say in each case how
much may be the work of Robert of Bellême himself.
The mounds&mdash;&#8203;natural hills improved by art&mdash;&#8203;and their
ditches are doubtless far older than his day; the walls
must often be far later. <span class="sni">Small architectural remains of the eleventh century.</span>
There is little architectural
detail left to decide such points; we are left to the less
certain evidence of masonry. Some of the masonry in
the inner building at Saônes certainly has the air of
work of the eleventh century. In any case, whatever
may be the exact amount of his work among the
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
existing remains, everything bears witness to the impression
which Robert’s invasion made on the district
and to the reputation which he left behind him. Not
far from Saônes, some remains of dykes, of the age or
object of which it would be rash to speak with certainty,
still keep the name of Robert the Devil.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Nature of the country and of the war.</span>
A visit to the scene of this war, a look-out from any
of the chief fortified points, brings forcibly home to us
the nature of that kind of struggle with which we are
dealing. Nothing but an actual sight of Italy and
Greece fully brings home to the mind the state of things
when each city was a sovereign commonwealth, armed
with all the powers of war and peace. Till we take in
the fact with our own eyes, we do not thoroughly understand
how men felt and acted when they constantly lived
with rivals, rivals who might at any moment become
enemies, within sight of their own territory. <span class="sni">Teaching of the landscapes in Maine.</span>
The out-look
from any of the Cenomannian heights, the out-look
from the home and centre of mischief on the hill of
Bellême, brings home to us another state of things with
equal force. Had the <em>commune</em> of Le Mans lived on,
had other neighbouring cities followed its example, the
older Greek, the later Italian, model might have been
seen in all its fulness on the soil of northern Gaul.
And warfare between Le Mans and Tours, between Le
Mans and Alençon, carried on with that mixture of lofty
and petty motives which is characteristic of warfare
between rival cities, would have been ennobling compared
with the state of things which actually was. <span class="sni">The castles.</span>
For
here we see every available point seized on to make
what, at least in the hands of Robert of Bellême, was a
mere den of robbers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_549" id="fnanchor_549"></a><a href="#footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></span>
From his own scarped mound at
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">220</span>
Bellême the destroyer could see far enough into the
Cenomannian land to give a keen whet to his appetite
for havoc. Within the land which thus lay open to
his attack, we see from every height the sites, not of
one or two only, but of a whole crowd of strongholds
which have passed away. A very few only of these
strongholds could ever have been needed for the protection
of any town or for the general defence of the
country. <span class="sni">Their object private war.</span>
They were strongholds which had been first
raised for the purpose of private war, and which, in the
hands of their present master, were turned to the purpose
of general oppression. One wonders how, in such
a state of things, when almost every village was overshadowed
by its robber’s nest, a single husbandman
could till his field, or a single merchant carry his wares
from town to town. <span class="sni">Contrast with England.</span>
And we must remember that,
unless during the nineteen years of anarchy, this state
of things never existed in England. Our forefathers
raised their wail over the building of the castles and over
the evil deeds which were wrought by those who built
them. <span class="sni">Comparative rarity of castles in England.</span>
But at no time in England, save on the borders
which were exposed to the foreign enemies of the
kingdom, did castles stand so thick on the ground as
they did in the land on which we now look. The eye
which has been used to track out the scenes of the Cenomannian
war comes back to an English landscape of the
same kind, to mark the steep bluff or the isolated mount,
which seems designed to be girt with a ditch and crowned
with a donjon, and almost to wonder that no ditch or
donjon ever was there. And, as we gaze on the land where
they crowned every tempting site, we better understand
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">221</span>
the joy and thankfulness with which men hailed the reign
of any prince who put some curb on the pride and power
of the knightly disturbers of the peace and gave to smaller
men some chance of possessing their own in safety. We
can understand how in such a prince this overwhelming
merit was held to outweigh not a few vices and crimes
in his own person. We can understand how, at the beginning
of every period of restored order, a general
sweeping away of castles was as it were the symbolic
act of its inauguration. <span class="sni">State of the Cenomannian castles.</span>
And perhaps the thought comes
all the more home to the mind, because the Cenomannian
castles are, to so great an extent, a memory and not a
presence. They are not like those castles by the Rhine
which have come to take their place as parts of a picturesque
landscape. As a rule, it is not the castles
themselves, but the sites where we know that they once
stood, which catch the eye as it ranges from Mamers to
Sillé, from Ballon to Alençon. But when we see how
many spots within that region had been made the sites
of these dens of havoc&mdash;&#8203;when we think how many of
them had, in the hands of Robert of Bellême, become
dens of havoc more fearful than ever&mdash;&#8203;we shall better
understand how men cherished the names of William
the Great and of his youngest son; we shall better
understand the work which had now to be done in the
Cenomannian land by one nobler than either the son or
the father.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Wrong and sacrilege of Robert of Bellême.</span>
In the minds of Helias and his contemporaries the
occupation of so large a part of their country was yet
more keenly embittered by the despite done to holy
places and the wrong wrought on men who enjoyed exceptional
respect even in the fiercest times. Some of the
strongholds of Robert the Devil were planted on lands
belonging to the Church, especially to the abbeys of
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pageno">222</span>
Saint Vincent and La Couture without the walls of Le
Mans. The peaceful tenants of these religious houses,
accustomed to a milder rule than their neighbours,
groaned under the oppressions of their new masters.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_550" id="fnanchor_550"></a><a href="#footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></span>
Stirred up by this wrong and sacrilege, the Count of
Maine marched forth to protect his people. Now that
the King was gone, he even ventured on something like
a pitched battle. <span class="sni">Helias defeats Robert at Saônes.</span>
He met Robert of Bellême at the head
of a superior force near the lake and castle of Saônes,
not far, it may be, from the dyke which specially bears
the tyrant’s name. The pious Count and his followers,
calling on God and Saint Julian, attacked the sacrilegious
invaders and put them to flight.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_551" id="fnanchor_551"></a><a href="#footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></span>
Several of the
nobles of Normandy were wounded or taken prisoners.
Robert of Courcy, a name not new to us,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_552" id="fnanchor_552"></a><a href="#footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></span>
lost his right
eye. William of Wacey and several others were taken,
and were released on the payment of heavy ransoms.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_553" id="fnanchor_553"></a><a href="#footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></span>
Helias, in short, carried on a defensive warfare in the
spirit of a Christian knight. Not so his enemy. <span class="sni">Cruelty of Robert.</span>
Robert
of Bellême carried on a war of aggression in the spirit
of a murdering savage. All the worst horrors of war
were let loose upon the land. Robert’s treatment of
prisoners was not that which the captive Normans met
with at the hands of Helias. In the holy season of
Lent, when other sinners, we are told, forsook their sins
for a while, the son of Mabel only did worse than ever.
Three hundred prisoners perished in his dungeons. Large
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">223</span>
ransoms were offered for their release; but Robert would
not forego for money the pleasure of letting them die of
cold, hunger, and wretchedness.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_554" id="fnanchor_554"></a><a href="#footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">April, 1098.</span>
The war thus went on till the end of April. On the
Wednesday in the last week of that month Helias made
an expedition against Robert. <span class="sni">Second victory of Helias. April 28, 1098.</span>
The exact point of attack
is not told us; but doubtless it was some of the fortresses
held by the enemy. It was perhaps Perray, the
hostile point furthest to the south, perhaps Saônes, the
scene of his own former victory over the invaders. The
starting-points of the Count’s operations were the two
points which he held as outposts of the city against
attacks from the north, Ballon and his own immediate
dwelling-place at Dangeul. From these castles Helias
led forth his forces. The day’s skirmish was successful;
the pride of Robert the Devil received another check.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_555" id="fnanchor_555"></a><a href="#footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></span>
But fortune soon turned from the better to the worse
cause. <span class="sni">Helias taken prisoner near Dangeul.</span>
The Count bade the main body of his followers
march on to Ballon, while he himself, with seven knights
only, was minded to halt at his own castle of Dangeul.
As he drew near to the fortress, he saw a few men lurking
among the trees and bushes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_556" id="fnanchor_556"></a><a href="#footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></span>
Trees and bushes are
still there in abundance, surrounding the modern house
which in a figure represents the castle of Helias. The
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
presence of liers-in-wait so near his own home was
threatening. Helias rode against them and scattered
them; in so doing he also scattered his own small party.
But the few men in the thickets were only the advanced
guard of a larger body. The arch-fiend Robert
was himself near in ambush. At the lucky moment he
sprang forth; his comrades seized the Count, along with
his standard-bearer Hervey of the Cenomannian Montfort,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_557" id="fnanchor_557"></a><a href="#footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></span>
and the more part of his small following. The
few who escaped made their way to Ballon, to turn the
joy of their comrades into sorrow at the news that
Count Helias was a prisoner.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_558" id="fnanchor_558"></a><a href="#footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Contrast between Robert of Bellême and William Rufus.</span>
The noblest man in Gaul was now at the mercy of the
vilest. Helias was helpless in the hands of Robert of
Bellême. The tale which follows is picturesque in itself,
and it is specially valuable as throwing light on the
mixed character of the Red King. With all his evil
deeds, he was at least not the worst man with whom
we have to do. We now see what mere chivalry could
do and what it could not do. It could not raise a man
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>
to the level of Helias; but it kept him from sinking to
the level of Robert of Bellême. <span class="sni">Helias surrendered to the King.</span>
Helias was far too important
a captive to be left to die a lingering death in
the dungeons of Robert. He was taken to Rouen, and
handed over to the King; and in the King’s hands he at
least ran no risk as to life or limb. William Rufus
might perhaps not understand a patriot fighting for his
city and country. He could perhaps understand a
prince fighting for the inheritance of his fathers. He
could most fully understand and admire a gallant and
honourable knight fighting manfully in any cause, even
though his gallantry was directed against himself. <span class="sni">William and Helias.</span>
In
one or other of those characters, Helias extorted a kind
of respect from the King who was so bitterly enraged
against him. <span class="sni">Helias kept at Rouen.</span>
The fortune of war had gone against
the defender of Maine, but William was not disposed
to press his advantage harshly. Helias was kept in
the castle of Rouen, a prisoner, but a prisoner whose
durance was, by the King’s express order, relieved by
honourable treatment.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_559" id="fnanchor_559"></a><a href="#footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">State of things at Le Mans; the new municipality.</span>
One element of the Cenomannian state, and that the
highest, was thus lost to it. But at Le Mans the prince
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
was only one element in the state; the ecclesiastical and
the civic powers appear alongside of him at every stage.
As soon as the Count was in the hands of the enemy, another
power, perhaps not the old <em>commune</em>, yet some form
of republican or municipal government, at once sprang
up. <span class="sni">Bishop Hildebert and the Council.</span>
Bishop Hildebert appears at the head of a council
or assembly of some kind which devised measures daily
for the safety of the commonwealth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_560" id="fnanchor_560"></a><a href="#footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></span>
We must not build
too much on the expressions of rhetorical writers who
loved to bring in classical allusions; still, considering
what Le Mans had been, a momentary burst of the old
freedom is no more than we might reasonably look for.
If so, the restored commonwealth had, at its first birth,
to brave the full might of the younger William, as the
former commonwealth had had to brave the full might
of the elder. We can only tell the tale as we have it,
and we have no means of connecting what was going on
in Maine with what was going on at the same time in
the Vexin. <span class="sni">William’s council at Rouen.</span>
Yet one is a little surprised to find William,
at this stage of the year, sitting quietly at Rouen, holding
a council, and presently sending forth orders for the
levying of a great army, as if two wars were not already
waging. <span class="sni">His speech.</span>
In his council of the Norman barons the Red
King is made to express himself in a humane and devout
strain. Hitherto he had been careless about winning
back the heritage of his father; he had been unwilling,
for the mere sake of enlarging his dominions, to
trouble a peaceful population or to cause the death of
human beings.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_561" id="fnanchor_561"></a><a href="#footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></span>
Now however God, who knew his
right, had, without any knowledge of his, delivered his
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">227</span>
enemy into his hands; what should he do further?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_562" id="fnanchor_562"></a><a href="#footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></span>
The writers of these times do indeed allow themselves
strange liberties in putting speeches, and sometimes very
inappropriate speeches, into the mouths of the actors in
their story. But surely to put words like these into
the mouth of William Rufus, as something uttered in
seriousness, would be going beyond any conceivable
licence of this kind. Considering his better authenticated
speeches, one is tempted to believe that we
have here the memory of some mocking gibe. He,
King William, had not laid waste the fields of Maine
nor caused men to die of hunger in prison. It was only
Robert of Bellême who had done such things. It would
be quite in character with Rufus, as with Jehu, to ask,
Who slew all these?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_563" id="fnanchor_563"></a><a href="#footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></span>
Nor is such brutal mockery in
any way inconsistent with the display of chivalrous
generosity whenever any appeal is made personally to
himself in his knightly character. <span class="sni">A great levy ordered.</span>
Anyhow we are told
that the barons advised that a summons should go forth
bidding the whole force of Normandy to come together
for an expedition to win back the land of Maine. They
themselves would come, willingly and with all daring, in
their own persons.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_564" id="fnanchor_564"></a><a href="#footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></span></p>

<p>All this reads strangely in a narrative which, a page
or two before, had told us of the warfare around Gisors
which, one would think, must have been going on at
this very moment. But we read that the messengers went
forth, and that the host came together. Not only from
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
Normandy, but from Britanny and Flanders, from Burgundy
and France&mdash;&#8203;not a word as to the treason implied
in this last name&mdash;&#8203;men flocked to the banners
of the prince who was so bountiful a paymaster.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_565" id="fnanchor_565"></a><a href="#footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></span>
At
some stage of their march, an aged French warrior, a
survivor of the wars of King Henry&mdash;&#8203;one therefore who
could remember the ambush of Varaville and the flames of
Mortemer, perhaps even the clashing of lances at Val-es-dunes&mdash;&#8203;Gilo
de Soleio by name, beheld the host from the
top of a high hill. <span class="sni">Numbers of the army.</span>
He had seen many and great gatherings
of men, but never on this side the Alps&mdash;&#8203;had he
fought then in Apulia or at Dyrrhachion?--had he seen
so vast an army. He told the number of the men at
fifty thousand.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_566" id="fnanchor_566"></a><a href="#footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></span>
Be the figures trustworthy or not as to
this particular army, this is one of several hints which
help to show us what passed in those days for an army
of unusual numbers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_567" id="fnanchor_567"></a><a href="#footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">The army meets at Alençon. June, 1098.</span>
The trysting-place of this great host was at Alençon,

Once famous as the town whose people had felt so stern
a vengeance for their insults to the great William, it was
now a stronghold of Normandy against Maine, at all
events a stronghold of Robert of Bellême against those
who still maintained the cause of the captive Helias.

Rufus, in invading
Maine, was repeating an exploit of his father. He
entered by the same road, and began by threatening the
same fortress. The words of our authorities may lead
us to think that he himself tarried at Alençon, while his
army, or the bulk of it, marched to Fresnay.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_570" id="fnanchor_570"></a><a href="#footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The army at Fresnay.</span>
Fresnay-le-Vicomte,
Fresnay-on-Sarthe, was the first castle in
Maine to which the Conqueror had laid siege, and under
its walls Robert of Bellême had been girt with the belt
of knighthood.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_571" id="fnanchor_571"></a><a href="#footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></span>
At that time Fresnay, along with Beaumont
lower down the river, had dared to withstand the
invader. Both fortresses stand on heights overlooking
the Sarthe; Fresnay, seated on a limestone rock rising
sheer from the stream, might seem well able to defy any
enemy. <span class="sni">The castle and church of Fresnay.</span>
Of the ancient part of the castle nothing is left
but shattered walls and a stern gateway of a later age.
The church, a gem of the art of an age nearly a hundred
years later, contains only a small part which can have
been standing in the days of Rufus. <span class="sni">Beaumont-le-Vicomte.</span>
Beaumont is not
mentioned in our present story. But its square keep
must have already looked down on the Sarthe and its
islands, while a mound on each side of the town, one
seemingly artificial, one by the river-side only improved
by art, may perhaps mark the sites of besieging towers
raised by the Conqueror to bring town and castle into
subjection.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_572" id="fnanchor_572"></a><a href="#footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></span>

the Viscount Hubert, had at a later stage forsaken both
his castles on the Sarthe, to defy, and that successfully,
the whole might of William the Great from his
more inaccessible donjon on the rock of Sainte-Susanne.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_573" id="fnanchor_573"></a><a href="#footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></span>
His successor, the Viscount Ralph, felt no call to run
any such risks. <span class="sni">The Viscount Ralph asks for a truce.</span>
When the army drew near to Fresnay,
when no hostilities beyond a little skirmishing had as
yet taken place, Ralph went to the King at Alençon and
asked for a truce. He pleaded that he was but one
member of a body; he could not take on himself the
duties of the head of that body; he could not without
dishonour be the first man in Maine to yield his castle
without fighting. The council of Maine was sitting in
the city; he, Ralph, was bound by their resolves; let
the King go on to Le Mans and negotiate; as he should
find peace or war at Le Mans, he should find peace or
war at Fresnay.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_574" id="fnanchor_574"></a><a href="#footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Rufus grants it.</span>
Rufus, always ready to answer any
appeal to his personal generosity, praised the proposal
of Ralph, and granted him the truce which he asked for.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_575" id="fnanchor_575"></a><a href="#footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></span>
He did the like to others whose lands lay on his line of
march. <span class="sni">Action of Geoffrey of Mayenne.</span>
Among these we hear of Rotrou of the Cenomannian
Montfort, and of one whose name has for so
many years been sure to meet us the first moment <a name="line230_1" id="line230_1"></a>he set
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
foot on Cenomannian soil, the now surely aged Geoffrey

<p><span class="sni">Estimate of their conduct.</span>
The conduct of these lords seems to show lukewarmness,
to say the least, in the cause of Cenomannian independence.
We are again reminded of the days of the
<em>commune</em>, of the unwillingness of the nobles to accept
the republican government, of the special treason of
Geoffrey himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_577" id="fnanchor_577"></a><a href="#footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></span>
We can understand that many of
the lords of castles throughout Maine, though they
might prefer their own count to the king who came
against them, might yet prefer the king to any form of
commonwealth. The local historian does not scruple to
use strong language on the subject. For we can hardly
doubt that Geoffrey, Ralph, Rotrou, and others in the
like case, are the persons who are referred to as the
faithless men by whose consent Rufus was led to hasten
to the city.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_578" id="fnanchor_578"></a><a href="#footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></span>
But the King had another motive to call
him thither. <span class="sni">Fulk Rechin at Le Mans.</span>
By this time there was no longer a commonwealth
to be dealt with; Le Mans had again a
prince, though no longer her native prince. <span class="sni">May 5, 1098.</span>
In the very
week after Helias was taken prisoner, Fulk of Anjou
came to Le Mans, and brought with him his son Geoffrey.
He himself came in his character of superior lord,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_579" id="fnanchor_579"></a><a href="#footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></span>
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">232</span>
while Geoffrey, to whom Eremburga, the only child of
Helias, was betrothed, might pass in some sort for the
heir of the county.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_580" id="fnanchor_580"></a><a href="#footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></span>
<span class="sni">He is received.</span>

<p><span class="sni">March of Rufus.</span>
Against this new enemy William Rufus set out from
Alençon. He had to overtake the host which was
already at Fresnay. He crossed the Sarthe; he continued
his course along its left bank, and stopped for the
first time at Rouessée-les-fontaines.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_582" id="fnanchor_582"></a><a href="#footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></span>
This point is no
great distance from Alençon, and it is still some way
north of Fresnay. The present village of Rouessée contains
no signs of any castle or mansion fitted for a
king’s reception. <span class="sni">Castle of Bourg-le-roi.</span>
One suspects that the exact spot
meant must be the neighbouring castle of Bourg-le-roi, a
castle said to take its name from Rufus himself. Here a
ruined round tower, with walls of amazing thickness
and girded by a deep ditch, looks down from a small
hill on what seems to be the preparation for a large
town which has never been built. A small village and
church are sheltered within walls of vast compass,
pierced by gates of later date than the days of Rufus
and Helias. His next stage is distinctly spoken of as
an encampment. The King had now joined his army.
<span class="sni">Rufus at Montbizot</span>
That night his camp was pitched at Montbizot, in the
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">233</span>
peninsula between the Sarthe and the Cenomannian
Orne.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_583" id="fnanchor_583"></a><a href="#footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></span>
<span class="sni">and Coulaines.</span>
On the third day he encamped in the meadows,
by the Sarthe, hard by the village of Coulaines.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_584" id="fnanchor_584"></a><a href="#footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></span>
He
was still on the left bank of the river, the same bank as
the city itself, though the bend which the stream makes
immediately under the hill of Le Mans gives the city
almost the look of standing on the other side. Wide
meadows spread from the village of Coulaines to the
foot of the hill; they were now covered by the tents of
Rufus. <span class="sni">View of Le Mans.</span>
Right before the eyes of the army, high on its
hill, rose the city which they were come to attack, and
it rose so as to bring at once before their leader’s eyes
the objects which would specially stir up his wrath. As
Le Mans is seen from the meadows of Coulaines, the
city and its hill lie almost out of sight to the south-west.
The prominent objects are those which stand in
the north-east corner of the city and in the adjoining
suburb. Highest of all, rising above the city itself,
soared the abbey of Saint Vincent without the walls,
the house whose tenants had been so cruelly oppressed
by Robert of Bellême.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_585" id="fnanchor_585"></a><a href="#footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></span>
Saint Julian’s, on its lower
ground, almost closes in the view on the other
side. When Rufus drew nigh, the twin towers of
Howel rose high in all the freshness of their newly-finished
masonry, to remind the King that the chair
of the prelate whom his father had appointed was now
filled by a successor in whose choice no regard had been
paid to his own pleasure. Between the two minsters
rose the royal tower, the tower of his father, the fortress
which had passed away from him and from his father’s
house, held no longer even by a rebellious vassal, as he
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pageno">234</span>
might deem Helias, but by the invading stranger from
Anjou. How deeply one at least of these feelings
rankled in the mind of Rufus is shown by his dealings
with the immediate neighbourhood of his encampment.
The village of Coulaines was an episcopal lordship. <span class="sni">Rufus ravages Coulaines.</span>
For
the churl chivalry taught no mercy; in his wrath
against Hildebert, the King burned the church and the
whole village, and cruelly laid waste the neighbouring
lands.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_586" id="fnanchor_586"></a><a href="#footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></span></p>

<p>But however fiercely Rufus might wreak his spite on
the unlucky lands and tenants of the bishopric without
the walls, the flock of Hildebert within the city was safe
for a while. Le Mans was not to pass into the King’s
hands just yet, and Ralph of Beaumont and Geoffrey of
Mayenne might still keep their bat-like nature for some
while longer. <span class="sni">Sally from the city.</span>
For it is at this stage that the local
historian places an exploit of the citizens of Le Mans
which reminds us of the way in which our own Godwine
was said to have won the special favour of Cnut
for himself and his fellow-Englishmen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_587" id="fnanchor_587"></a><a href="#footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></span>
The men of the
city marched forth&mdash;&#8203;whether under Angevin leadership
we are not told&mdash;&#8203;to attack the King’s camp at Coulaines.
<span class="sni">Rufus goes away.</span>
Rufus, deeming that some treachery was on
foot, marched off in the night with his army. In the
morning the citizens occupied the camp and found no
one there.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_588" id="fnanchor_588"></a><a href="#footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></span>
It is hard to say what we are to make of
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pageno">235</span>
this story, which has a somewhat mythical sound. But
it has at least thus much of truth in it, that Rufus was
obliged to break up the siege of Le Mans for a while.
<span class="sni">Ballon betrayed to Rufus and occupied by Robert of Bellême.</span>
The castle of Ballon, of which we have already so
often heard, was betrayed to Rufus by its lord Pagan
of Mont-Doubleau, and it was held that this strong
position, nearly due north of the city, almost put the
city itself into the King’s power. Robert of Bellême
was put in command at Ballon, with three hundred
knights. At his bidding the land was ravaged in every
way; the vines were rooted up and the crops were
trampled down. But at last the invaders began to feel
the effects of the damage they themselves had done. A
failure of provisions, especially of oats for the horses,
hindered the Red King from keeping on the siege.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_589" id="fnanchor_589"></a><a href="#footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The siege of Le Mans raised.</span>
He
went away into Normandy, bidding his men go home
and see to their harvests, and come again when the crops
were reaped.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_590" id="fnanchor_590"></a><a href="#footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></span>
Nothing is more natural in the case of
the native Normans, who would feel in such a case very
much as Englishmen felt; but one can hardly believe
that William allowed his great mercenary force to be
wholly broken up. And again, the question keeps always
presenting itself, What was going on in the Vexin?
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
Was there any moment when so eager a warrior, with
two wars on his hands at once, left both of them to take
care of themselves? Throughout this story the relations
between the French and the Cenomannian wars form a
never-ceasing puzzle. But we presently come to an
incident of the campaign which is the most characteristic
in the whole history of William Rufus.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Fulk attacks Ballon.</span>
While William was away, Count Fulk, at the head of
a mixed host, Angevin and Cenomannian, laid siege to
the newly-betrayed castle of Ballon. The attack went
on for some days; a message was sent to the King
for help. To meet this fresh danger, the nobles of
Maine and Anjou pressed in greater numbers to help the
Count and his force. <span class="sni">Successful sally of the besieged.</span>
The defenders of the castle
planned a sally. Beggars went out as spies, and brought
in news that the besiegers were busy dining at the
hour of tierce. The sally was made; the besiegers were
surprised in the midst of their meal;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_591" id="fnanchor_591"></a><a href="#footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></span>
a hundred and
forty knights and a crowd of foot-soldiers were taken
prisoners. The rest took to flight and left a rich spoil
of arms, clothes, and furniture as a prey to the Normans.
Many of the captives were men of high rank and
great possessions. The story almost reads as if Robert
of Bellême condemned them to die of hunger; if so,
Rufus came before hunger had done its work; cold
would no longer be a means of torture. <span class="sni">William at Ballon, c. July 20, 1098.</span>
It was now
not Lent, but the third week in July, when King
William with a great force came to Ballon. A cry
presently reached him from the prisoners, “Noble King
William, set us free.” The chivalrous King, who had
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">237</span>
no mercy for the peasants of Coulaines, felt his heart
stirred towards the captive knights of Anjou. <span class="sni">His treatment of the captive knights.</span>
He
ordered that a meal should be made ready for them
along with his own followers, and he set them free on
their parole till the meal was ready. Some of his companions
suggested to him that, in the crowd and confusion,
they might easily escape. Rufus cast aside
such a suggestion with scorn. He would never believe
that a good knight would break his word; he who
should do so would have punishment enough in the
scorn of all mankind that would follow him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_592" id="fnanchor_592"></a><a href="#footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Illustration of the chivalrous spirit.</span>
Here we
see the chivalrous character in all its fulness. Justice
and mercy go for nothing; the law of God and the law
of man go for nothing; the oath of the crowned king,
the promise of a prince and a brother, go for nothing;
but the class tie of knighthood is sacred; the promise
made under its guaranty is sacred. As a good knight,
William Rufus is faithful to his own word pledged as
such to others; as a good knight, he will not believe
that a brother of his order can be other than faithful to
his word pledged as such to him.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Fulk goes back to Le Mans.</span>
The siege of Ballon was at an end. Fulk, we are
told, betook himself to the city, and there stayed in
some of the monasteries, waiting to see what would
happen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_593" id="fnanchor_593"></a><a href="#footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></span>
But the defenders of Le Mans, both native
and Angevin, had now made up their minds that resistance
to the power of Rufus was hopeless; their
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pageno">238</span>
object was to treat for peace. <span class="sni">Negotiations for peace.</span>
The captive Helias was
allowed a share in the negotiations; he was specially
fearful that Fulk might make some agreement by which
he himself might be cut off from Maine for ever.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_594" id="fnanchor_594"></a><a href="#footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Share of Helias.</span>
By
the King’s leave, Bishop Hildebert and some of the chief
men of the city visited Helias, and they agreed on terms
which were put into the form of an agreement between
Rufus and Fulk. <span class="sni">Convention between William and Fulk. August, 1098.</span>
It was rather a military convention
than a treaty of peace, and it left all the disputed questions
unsettled. Nothing was said either as to the
general question about the bishopric or as to the particular
election of Hildebert. Nor was it at all ruled
who was to be looked on as lawful Count of Maine. It
was not even agreed that hostilities were to cease. The
actual terms are conceived in words which seem to
come from Rufus himself. The memory of his father is
put prominently forward. <span class="sni">Le Mans to be surrendered.</span>
Le Mans and all the fortresses
which had been held by the late King William
were to be surrendered to King William his son. <span class="sni">Helias to be set free.</span>
Helias
and all other prisoners on both sides were to be set free.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_595" id="fnanchor_595"></a><a href="#footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></span>
All sides, we are told, rejoiced at this agreement. To
William and his followers it was a great immediate
triumph. To the people of Le Mans it was at least
immediate deliverance from a wasting struggle. And
wary men may have seen that the liberation of Helias
was not too dearly bought even by the surrender of his
capital. If the valiant Count were set free, free alike
from fetters and from promises, he would win back his
lost city and dominion before long.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Submission of Le Mans.</span>
But for the present all went according to the pleasure
of the Red King. Rufus, as his father had twice done,
entered Le Mans without bloodshed, amidst at least the
outward welcome of its inhabitants. And it may well
be that, if Helias was not to be had, they may have
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
looked on William as a more promising master than
Fulk. The convention was formally accepted, and it
was immediately carried out. <span class="sni">The castles occupied by the King’s troops.</span>
Robert the son of Hugh
of Montfort, that Hugh whom we have already heard of
on Senlac and at Dover,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_596" id="fnanchor_596"></a><a href="#footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></span>
was sent at the head of seven
hundred chosen knights, full armed in their helmets and
coats of mail, to occupy the fortresses of Le Mans.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_597" id="fnanchor_597"></a><a href="#footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></span>
They met with no opposition; the garrisons, native or
Angevin, marched out; the Normans took possession.
All the strong places of the city&mdash;&#8203;the ancient palace of
the counts on the Roman wall&mdash;&#8203;the donjon of William
the Great, the royal tower, standing so dangerously near
to the north wall of Saint Julian’s minster&mdash;&#8203;the other
fortress of the Conqueror, the tower of Mont Barbet on
its height, overlooking the city from the side of Saint
Vincent’s abbey&mdash;&#8203;all that the father had either subdued
or called into being&mdash;&#8203;now passed without a blow into
the hands of the son. The King’s banner&mdash;&#8203;what was
the ensign wrought upon it?--was hoisted amid shouts of
victory on the highest point of the royal tower. King
William the Red had achieved the object which in his
thoughts came nearest to the nature of a duty. He had
brought under his hand all that had ever been under the
hand of his father.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_598" id="fnanchor_598"></a><a href="#footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
<span class="sni">William’s entry into Le Mans.</span>
On the day of the military occupation followed the
day of the joyous entry. The Red King entered, doubtless
by the northern gate, the gate between Saint Vincent’s
abbey and the royal tower. His new subjects
welcomed him with shouts and songs, and were received
by him to his full peace.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_599" id="fnanchor_599"></a><a href="#footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His reception by Hildebert.</span>
Bishop Hildebert, seemingly
now admitted to favour, with his clergy and people, met
the King with psalms and processions. They led him
by the royal tower, with his own banner floating on its
battlements, to the cathedral church, now a vaster and
more splendid pile than when the first Conqueror had
been led to it with the same pomp.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_600" id="fnanchor_600"></a><a href="#footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The church of Saint Julian.</span>
The twin towers of
Howel soared in their freshness; the aisles which we
still see, with their abiding Roman masonry, had risen at
his bidding; it may well have been by the mighty
portal of his rearing that Rufus entered within the hallowed
walls. Within, the sight was different in every
stone, in every adornment, from that on which we now
gaze. The columns and arches of Saint Julian’s nave
were still the columns and arches of the basilica which
Aldric had raised when Le Mans was a city of the Empire
of the pious Lewis.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_601" id="fnanchor_601"></a><a href="#footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></span>
It may be that of those
columns we can here and there spell out some faint
traces amid the finer masonry and gorgeous foliage of
the next age. But of the works to the east, still new
when Rufus came, the splendid reconstructions of later
times have left us no signs. The choir of Arnold still
blazed in all its freshness with the rich decorations
which had been added by the skill and bounty of
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>
Howel. The first bloom had not passed away from the
painted ceiling, from the rich pavement, from the narrow
windows glowing with the deep richness of colour which
no later age could surpass. Through all these new-born
splendours of the holy place the scoffer and blasphemer
was solemnly guided to the shrines of Saint Julian and
of all the saints of Le Mans. And there were moments
when the heart of Rufus was not wholly shut against
better thoughts. As at Saint Martin of the Place of
Battle, so at Saint Julian in newly-won Le Mans, we
may deem that some dash of thankfulness was mingled
with his swelling pride, as he felt that he had finished
his father’s work.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">William leaves Le Mans.</span>
The stay of William at Le Mans does not seem to
have been long. The government of the city was put
into the hands of Count William of Evreux and of
Gilbert of Laigle. The royal tower, well provisioned,
stocked with arms and with all needful things, was
placed under the immediate command of Walter the son
of Ansgar of Rouen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_602" id="fnanchor_602"></a><a href="#footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></span>
<span class="sni">General submission of Maine.</span>
The nobles of Maine now came in
to make their submission and to receive the King’s
garrisons into their castles. Among them were Count
Geoffrey of Mayenne and the Viscount Ralph of Beaumont.
The terms of their engagement were fulfilled.
Their castles were to follow the fortune of Le Mans,
and Le Mans now was King William’s.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_603" id="fnanchor_603"></a><a href="#footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">But he who had lately been the lord of them all
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">242</span>
was waiting for the benefits of the convention to be
extended to himself. We are a little surprised when we
presently find the King at Rouen, and when we further
find that Helias, who had been lately in ward in the
castle there, had now to be brought hither from a prison
at Bayeux.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_604" id="fnanchor_604"></a><a href="#footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Meeting of William and Helias.</span>
The King and his captive met face to face.
The contrast between the outward look of the two men
was as striking as the difference in their inward souls.
Before the victorious King, short, bulky, ruddy, fierce of
countenance, hasty and stammering in speech, stood the
captive Count, tall, thin, swarthy, master of eloquent
and winning words. Something of bodily neglect
marked, perhaps not so much the rigour of his confinement
as a captive’s carelessness of wonted niceties.
His hair, usually neatly trimmed, was now rough and
shaggy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_605" id="fnanchor_605"></a><a href="#footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></span>
The King seems to have begun the dialogue;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_606" id="fnanchor_606"></a><a href="#footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></span>
“I have you, Sir.” Helias answered with dignity and
respect, as a man of fallen fortunes speaking to a
superior in rank, and yet not stooping to any unworthy
submission. <span class="sni">Proposals of Helias.</span>
He called on the King, in the name of his
might and his renown, to help him. He had once, he
said, been a count, lord of a noble county. Fortune
had now turned against him, and he had lost all. He
asked leave to enter the King’s service, to be allowed to
keep his rank and title of count, but pledging himself
not to make any claim to the Cenomannian county or
city, till by some signal exploit on the King’s behalf he
should be deemed worthy to receive them as a grant from
the King’s free will. Till then it would be enough for
him to have his place in the royal following and to
enjoy the royal friendship.</p>

<p><span class="sni">William disposed to accept Helias’ proposal.</span>
Such an appeal as this went straight to the better
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
part of William’s nature, and he was at once disposed
to agree to the proposal of Helias. But then stepped in
the selfish prudence of Robert of Meulan, who measured
other men by himself. <span class="sni">He is hindered by Robert of Meulan.</span>
He was now the King’s chief
adviser, and he jealously grudged all influence which
might fall to the lot of any one else.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_607" id="fnanchor_607"></a><a href="#footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></span>
The admission of
Helias to the King’s friendship and councils would of all
things be the least suited for Robert’s purposes. He
could not bear that any man, least of all a man of a
spirit so much higher than his own, should be so near
the throne as Helias threatened to be. The men of
Maine, said the Count of Meulan, were a cunning and
faithless race. All that the captive Helias sought by
his offers was to insinuate himself into the King’s
favour, to learn his secrets, that he might be able,
when a fitting moment came, to rise up against him
with more advantage and join himself to his enemies
with greater power. The purpose of Rufus was
changed by the malignant counsel of Count Robert.
The petition of Helias was refused; it was again made;
it was again refused. <span class="sni">Defiance of Helias.</span>
Then the Count of Maine spoke
his defiance. “Willingly, Sir King, would I have served
you, if it had been your pleasure; willingly would I
have earned favour in your sight. But now, I pray you,
blame me not, if I take another course. I cannot bear
with patience to see mine inheritance taken from me.
All right is denied to me by overwhelming violence;
wherefore let no man wonder if I again renew my claim,
if I strive with all my might to win back the honour of
my fathers.” Rufus was beside himself with wrath at
words like these; but it was in words only that his
wrath spent itself. He stammered out, “Scoundrel, what
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
can you do? Be off, march, take to flight; <span class="sni">Answer of Rufus.</span>
I give you
leave to do all you can, and, by the face of Lucca, if
you ever conquer me, I will not ask you for any grace
in return for my favour of to-day.” Even after this outburst,
the Count had self-command enough to ask for a
safe-conduct, and the King had self-command enough to
grant it. <span class="sni">Helias set free.</span>
Helias was guided safely through the Norman
duchy, and made his way, to the delight of his friends,
to his own immediate possessions on the borders of
Maine and Anjou.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_608" id="fnanchor_608"></a><a href="#footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Illustration of the King’s character.</span>
Of all the stories of the Red King there is none more
characteristic than this. His first impulse is to accept
a generous and confiding offer in the spirit in which it
was made. For a moment he seems to rise to the level
of the man who stood before him. Even when his
better impulse is checked by an evil counsellor, he does
not sink so low as many would have sunk in the like
case. In the wildest wrath of his insulted pride, he does
not forget that his word as a good knight is pledged
to the man who has defied him. Rufus was bound by all
the laws of chivalry to let Helias go this time, whatever
he might do if he caught him again. And the laws
of chivalry Rufus obeyed in the teeth of temptations of
opposite kinds. A meaner tyrant might have sent
Helias at once to death or blinding. A calmer or more
wary prince, even though not a tyrant, might have
argued that it was unsafe for him and his dominions to
let the man go free who had uttered such a challenge.
He might further have argued that a speech which was
so like an open declaration of war at once set aside
the conditions of peace. But William Rufus, when
once on his point of honour, was not led away from
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">245</span>
it either by the impulse of vengeance or by the calculations
of prudence. His knightly word was pledged that
Helias should go free. Free therefore he went, after
his defiance had been answered by a counter defiance,
each alike emphatically characteristic of the man who
uttered it.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§ 3. <span class="title">The End of the French War</span>.<br />
<i>September-December</i>, 1098.</p>

<p>The war of Maine was, or seemed to be, over. And,
just at this point we get a chronology clear enough to
enable us to fix the connexion of the two works which
were going on at once. We have seen William in his
Norman capital at a time when we should rather have
looked for him on one or other of his Norman frontiers.
<span class="sni">William on the continent. 1097&ndash;1099.</span>
But it seems plain that he spent the whole year on the
mainland, and that he did not cross to England at any
time between the two Christmas feasts which he is
specially said to have kept in Normandy. Helias was
set free in August, and we are led to believe that Rufus
now deemed that the war of Maine was over, or at least
that he could afford to despise it in its present stage.
<span class="sni">Extent of William’s conquests in Maine.</span>
We shall presently see that the war of Maine was by no
means over, and that William’s Cenomannian conquests
hardly reached beyond the capital and the lands north
of the capital. <span class="sni">He begins, but does not finish.</span>
We are inclined to wonder that a warlike
prince like Rufus took no further heed to a campaign
which was manifestly unfinished, while an active enemy
was again at liberty and was still in possession of a
strong line of castles. But this is neither the first nor
the last time in which we find William the Red much
more vigorous in beginning a campaign than in ending
it. And in this case he may, with two wars on his
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">246</span>
hands, have not unreasonably thought that, after so
great a conquest as that of the capital of Maine, he could
afford to turn his thoughts to the other seat of warfare.
In the month after Helias was set free, he made up his
mind for a special effort against the stubborn border-land
of France.</p>

<p><span class="sni">William sets forth. September 27, 1098.</span>
Two days before Michaelmas, William set forth, from
what head-quarters we are not told, at the head of a
great army. On his way to the seat of war he enjoyed
the hospitality of Ralph of Toesny on the hill of Conches.
That night there was a sign in the heavens; <span class="sni">The sign in the sky.</span> the whole
sky blazed and seemed as red as blood. At other times
such a portent in the heavens might not have seemed too
great to betoken some great victory or defeat on the part
of one or other of the contending kings of the West.
But, while Christendom was on its march to the eastern
land, the heavens could tell of nothing meaner than
the ups and downs of the strifes between two continents
and two creeds. <span class="sni">Its meaning.</span>
If the sky was red over
Conches and Evreux and the whole western world, it
was because at that moment Christians and heathens
met in battle in the eastern lands, and by God’s help the
Christians had the victory.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_609" id="fnanchor_609"></a><a href="#footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></span>
But William Rufus cared
little for signs and wonders, even when he himself was
deemed to be the subject of their warning. His heart
was not in Palestine, but on the French border; and his
present business was a march against the most distant
of the three fortresses to which he laid claim. Chaumont
and Trie still held out; but their garrisons could
not hinder him from carrying a destructive raid into
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
districts far more distant from his head-quarters at
Gisors. <span class="sni">He marches to Pontoise.</span>
He marched to the south-east, burning, plundering,
and carrying off prisoners from the whole French
territory as far as Pontoise.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_610" id="fnanchor_610"></a><a href="#footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></span></p>

<p>The invading King had now reached a point of
French soil nearer to Paris than the spot where Count
Robert kept the Seine barred at Meulan. At Pontoise,
as the name implies, was the bridge spanning the Oise,
the tributary which joins its waters with those of the
Seine at Conflans&mdash;&#8203;the Gaulish <em>Confluentes</em>&mdash;between
Paris and Meulan. <span class="sni">Castle and town of Pontoise.</span>
Here a precipitous rock rises above
the stream, a rock which, strengthened and defended by
art in every way, was crowned by the vast circuit of the
castle of Pontoise. Here is no town sloping down from
the castle to the river. The castle rock rises sheer&mdash;&#8203;it
rose most likely from the water itself, till the Oise, like
the Seine at Rouen, was curbed by a quay. In the view
from the bridge, the castle, shorn as it is of its towers
and of all that can give stateliness to such a building,
still lords it over everything. The town of Pontoise
seems to crouch by the side of the rock; the great
church of Saint Maclou, with its lofty tower of late
architecture, is wholly hidden from sight. It is only at
some distance beyond the river, in the suburb known as
that of Saint Ouen <em>l’Aumône</em>, that we begin to see that
the church stands on ground not much lower than
the site of the castle. <span class="sni">Strong position of the town.</span>
We then learn that the town of
Pontoise, standing on a height separate from the castle-rock,
well walled, and with streets as steep as those of Le
Mans or Lincoln, was in itself no contemptible fortress.
As usual, there is little or nothing in town or church or
castle that we can positively assign to the period of our
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">248</span>
story. But the main features of the spot must be the
same now as they were when the Red King led his
plundering host as far as the bridge of the Oise. <span class="sni">Pontoise the furthest point of the raid.</span>
It is
plain that this was the end of his course on this side;
it is plain that Pontoise was not added to the list of
fortresses which were taken by him or betrayed to him.
But we have nothing to explain why he turned back at
this point, whether he met with any repulse in an
attack on Pontoise or whether he attacked Pontoise at
all. We only know that Pontoise marks in one sense
the furthest point of the French campaigns of William
Rufus. We shall presently find him on another side
at a greater distance from his own dominions; but
Pontoise marks his nearest approach to the capital of
France. Had Pontoise been William’s as well as Meulan,
Paris would indeed have been threatened. But this south-eastern
journey was clearly, in its effect at least, a
mere plundering raid, from which Rufus came back to
attempt a more regular attack on the nearer enemy at
Chaumont.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Siege of Chaumont.</span>
The siege of Chaumont is described to us in greater
detail than the march on Pontoise, but we do not,
any more than at Pontoise, get a really intelligible
account. It is plain that the siege was a considerable
enterprise, one to which Rufus led his whole army. It
is also plain from the result that its issue must have
an important effect on the turn of affairs. But of
the siege itself all that we hear is one of those
strange stories by which we are sometimes met, stories
which must have some meaning, which must be
grounded on some fact, and which yet, as they stand,
pass all belief. We are told that the defenders of Chaumont
were valiant men, strong to defend the battlements
of their own castle. But to defend their own castle was
all that they could do; their numbers were not enough
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
to enable them either to meet William’s great army in
open battle, or even to hinder his plunderers from laying
waste the neighbouring lands. But the defence of
Chaumont itself was stout, and, as it turned out, successful.
<span class="sni">The archers of Chaumont shoot the horses only.</span>
Yet we are told that the garrison of Chaumont,
out of the fear of God and out of tenderness towards
men, stood strictly on the defensive, or took the offensive
only towards brute beasts. In taking aim at the besiegers,
they avoided the persons of the riders, and
aimed all their blows at the horses. Seven hundred
horses of great price fell under the arrows and darts of
the men of Chaumont, and their carcases made a rich
feast for the dogs and birds of prey of the Vexin.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_611" id="fnanchor_611"></a><a href="#footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Chaumont not taken.</span>
The
virtue of these scrupulous warriors did not go unrewarded.
Our story breaks off somewhat suddenly; but
we see that at all events Chaumont was not taken.</p>

<p class="p2">The war now takes a turn of special interest, which
makes us specially regret the very unsatisfactory nature
of our materials. The field of our story is suddenly enlarged;
but events do not crowd it at all in proportion
to its enlargement. <span class="sni">Rare notices of southern Gaul.</span>
It is but seldom that our tale brings
us into any direct dealing with the lands and the princes
south of the Loire. We have seen the tongue of <dfn>oil</dfn>
supplant the Danish tongue in Normandy, and we have
seen it appear as a rival to our own speech in our own
island. But we have been seldom called on to listen to
the accents of the tongue of <dfn>oc</dfn>. But at this moment the
chief potentate of that tongue suddenly appears on the
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>
field of our story, an appearance from which we naturally
look for great events. The young lord of the Vexin and
heir of France had to meet a new enemy, almost as
powerful, and quite as reckless and godless, as the old
one. <span class="sni">Coming of William of Poitiers.</span>
Another William, William of Poitiers and Aquitaine,
came to the help of William of Normandy and
England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_612" id="fnanchor_612"></a><a href="#footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></span>
<a name="line250_8" id="line250_8"></a>He was in the end to go to the crusade&mdash;&#8203;to
go not exactly in the guise of Godfrey or Helias.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_613" id="fnanchor_613"></a><a href="#footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></span>
But
he had not yet set out; and, before he went, he came to
strike a blow on behalf of the prince to whom he was said
to have sold the reversion of his dominions. <span class="sni">Alliance of Normandy and Aquitaine.</span>
The mighty
dukes of the North and the South might seem to have
utterly hemmed in the smaller realm of the king whose
men they were or should have been.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_614" id="fnanchor_614"></a><a href="#footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></span>
The final results of
their alliance were not memorable, but the coming of the
southern duke had the immediate effect of carrying the
war into districts little used to the presence of English
or even of Norman warriors.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Campaign to the west of Paris.</span>
It can hardly fail to have been the march of William
of Aquitaine which led to a campaign carried on in the
lands west and south-west of Paris, within the triangle
which may be drawn between the three points of
Mantes, Paris, and Chartres. One side of this triangle
is formed by the Seine itself, and here the adhesion of
the Count of Meulan must have effectually guarded the
seat of war from the north. Somewhat to the west of
Meulan, between that fortress and Mantes, the small
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">251</span>
stream of the Maudre empties itself into the Seine.
<span class="sni">Valley of the Maudre.</span>
The course of this stream and the valley through
which it flows formed the chief seat of warfare at this
stage, seemingly after the attacks on Chaumont had
proved fruitless. Small as the Maudre is, its course
makes a clearly marked valley, running nearly north
and south. <span class="sni">Maule.</span>
About the middle of it lies Maule, the
fortress of Peter of Maule, the benefactor of the house
of Saint Evroul, and therefore high in favour with its
historian. Further to the south, where the stream is
a mere brook, the valley widens into a plain between
hills, and here some of the strongest points are occupied
by the strongholds of the French house of Montfort,
numbering among them the spot which gave that house
its ever-memorable name. <span class="sni">Montfort-l’Amaury.</span>
Here rose the hill which
above all others glories in the name of the Strong
Mount, the home of the Simons and the Amalrics.
Under the name of Montfort-l’Amaury it still keeps the
less illustrious of the two names, one or other of
which was always borne by its successive counts. <span class="sni">Neauphlé-le-Château.</span>
To
the north-east of the cradle of their race, on the other
side of the Maudre, the Counts of Montfort had planted
another stronghold on a height, which, though all traces
of a fortress have passed away, still keeps the name of
Neauphlé-<em>le-Château</em>, as distinguished from another
place of the same name, Neauphlé-<em>le-Vieux</em>. <span class="sni">Epernon.</span>
Much
further to the south-west, on the upper course of the
Drouelle, a tributary of the Eure, stood Epernon, another
fortress of the house of Montfort, a border fortress of
the strictly French territory towards the lands of the
Counts of Chartres. <span class="sni">The two Williams march against the Montfort castles.</span>
On this district now fell the heavy
wrath of the two Williams, who led a mighty multitude
against Montfort and Epernon and laid waste the whole
surrounding land. They had traitors in their service;
they came under the guidance of Almaric the Young and
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">252</span>
of Nivard of Septeuil.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_615" id="fnanchor_615"></a><a href="#footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></span>
This last place lies in the valley
of the Vaucouleurs, a stream running almost parallel
with the Maudre and joining the Seine at Mantes. Such
a position, lying nearly due west from Maule, and at
a greater distance north-east from Montfort, marks a
dangerous outpost thrown out from the Norman side
into the heart of the French territory. <span class="sni">Seat of war affected by the coming of William of Poitiers.</span>
Of the line of
march of the Poitevin duke we have no account; but it
must have been his coming which caused the seat of war
to be changed from the north-west of the threatened
capital of France to the south-west, a region so much
better suited for an invader from the south.</p>

<p><span class="sni">No special mention of Lewis.</span>
It is somewhat singular that, while we have so striking
a general picture of the courage and conduct of the
young Lewis during this struggle, we hear nothing of
any particular exploit of his, we hear nothing of any
help given by him to any of the threatened fortresses.
It is their own lords, each for himself, who withstand,
and successfully withstand, the attacks of the powers of
North and South. Our chief informant&mdash;&#8203;English, Norman,
and French, all at once&mdash;&#8203;enlarges on the failure of
Philip to give any help to his vassals; but we should
never learn from him that his place was supplied by his
son.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_616" id="fnanchor_616"></a><a href="#footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The castles resist singly.</span>
Every man, it would seem, fought for his own
hand. We are told this of a crowd of unnamed lords
defending unnamed fortresses. <span class="sni">Peter of Maule.</span>
But we are not left to
guess at the name of the friend of Saint Evroul, Peter of
Maule, who, with his sons Ansold and Theobald, successfully
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">253</span>
defended his fortress in the valley of the Maudre.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_617" id="fnanchor_617"></a><a href="#footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></span>
We must suppose that the forces of the two Williams
were scattered and frittered away in a series of desultory
attacks against strongholds scattered all over
the country. <span class="sni">The two Simons of Montfort.</span>
But to us at least the main interest of
the campaign gathers round the dwellings of the house
of Montfort. We should be well pleased to have even
such details of a warfare which affected them as we have
had of the sieges of Chaumont and as we shall presently
have of the siege of Mayet. But we hear only of the
result, how the arms of the two Simons, elder and
younger, <span class="sni">The elder Simon defends Neauphlé.</span> defended all the possessions which looked up to
the Strong Mount as their head.
The elder guarded the
height of Neauphlé, where a curve in the hills, theatre-shape,
awakens some faint remembrance of the kingly
mount of Laon.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_618" id="fnanchor_618"></a><a href="#footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The castle of Montfort.</span>
But the <em>Mons fortis</em> itself, the hill from
whence, in after times, Simon the father went to work
the bondage of Toulouse and Simon the son to work the
freedom of England, must have been among the strongholds
which were saved by the energy of the younger
bearer of the name which was to be so fearfully and
so gloriously renowned. High on its peninsular hill,
still keeping some small traces of elder towers along
with one graceful fragment of far later days, the castle
of Montfort looks down over church and town, over
hills and plains, bidding defiance to foes on every side,
but bidding the most direct defiance of all to any
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
foe who should advance by the path which must
have been trodden by the Aquitanian duke. For of
all the outlooks from the height of Montfort the
widest and the most striking is that by which the eye
looks out towards those southern lands which came so
near to forming a South-Gaulish realm for its own
lords. <span class="sni">The church.</span>
The church stands beneath on a lower point of
the steep. The works of later times, which have filled
its windows with the painted forms of the basest of the
later Valois, have spared one side of the more ancient
central tower, preserving to us forms which were looked
on, not indeed by the Simons of our own immediate story,
but by the Simon of Muret and the Simon of Evesham.
A gate at the base of the castle mound, though the
actual building must be of later date, still keeps the
name of that Hugh Bardolf, himself joined by a tie of
affinity to the house of Montfort, of whom we have
heard elsewhere as one of the most abiding of the enemies
of Normandy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_619" id="fnanchor_619"></a><a href="#footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Defence of the younger Simon.</span>
Here, while the father defended
Neauphlé, the son defended the cradle of their race, and
their other outlying possessions. Not a detail is given
us; but our historian emphatically tells us that it was
by the help of God that the lords of Montfort kept their
fortresses safe from the twofold enemy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_620" id="fnanchor_620"></a><a href="#footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Interest of the defence.</span>
And, though
a King of the English marched against them, though
doubtless there was no lack of native English warriors
in his train, yet we may join in the pious thankfulness
of our guide at Saint Evroul. It was not good for
English interests in any wide or lasting sense that the
sovereign of England should even hold his ancestral
Normandy, much less that he should inherit Aquitaine
and conquer France. When the lords of Montfort in the
eleventh century beat back from their strongholds all
the efforts of England and Normandy, of Poitiers and
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
Aquitaine, they were in truth working in the same
cause as their glorious descendant in the thirteenth.
Unknowingly and indirectly, they were, no less than he,
fighting for the freedom and the greatness of what in their
eyes seemed hostile England.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The war lingers on. Christmas, 1098.</span>
The war seems to have lingered on through another
winter, the second of those when King William kept his
Christmas feast in Normandy. But no successes are
recorded either of William of England or of William of
Aquitaine. <span class="sni">No successes of the two Williams.</span>
The Red King had really done nothing,
either alone or in company with his Poitevin ally. The
gallant resistance of the men of the French borderland
had beaten him back at every point.
He was now glad
to conclude a truce, <span class="sni">A truce agreed to.</span> which the events which followed
made practically a peace.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_621" id="fnanchor_621"></a><a href="#footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Survey of the French war. Its ill-success.</span>
It is not at first easy to understand why so very little
came of such great preparations as those which William
Rufus made for the French war. The strength of two
great states, during the later stages of the war the
strength of three great states, was broken by efforts
which, even allowing as much as we can for the energy
of young Lewis, were mainly those of the nobles and
people of a single district. England, Normandy, and
Aquitaine, were baffled by the men of the French Vexin.
It is true indeed that the war of Maine was far from
being really ended, but Rufus seems at this stage to have
thought little of the efforts of the man whom he had
bidden to do his worst against him. Nor was there anything
this year in England, as there was the year before,
to draw off the King’s attention from continental affairs.
Scotland was quiet under a king of his own naming;
Magnus did not really threaten England; the Welsh border
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
might be left to Robert of Bellême or those whom he
had left in charge. All that we can do is to record this
singular break-down of a great force, without being able
fully to explain it. One remark may be made. <span class="sni">Illustration of William’s character.</span>
Men of
the temper of Rufus often get simply weary of undertakings
which bring little success, and in which there is
nothing to call forth any special point of personal vengeance
or personal honour. Rufus claimed the Vexin;
but his heart does not seem to have been set on its
possession, as it clearly was set on the possession of
Le Mans. There was no one on the French border who
had stung him personally to the quick as Helias had
done. The want of success in the joint undertaking of
the two Williams is certainly hard to understand; but
we can quite understand how William of England and
Normandy might, in sheer disgust, throw up an undertaking

he was once more wounded in the most sensitive
part, he was, as we shall presently see, all himself

<p class="p2 center">§ 4. <span class="title">The Gemót of 1099.</span></p>

<p>William, master of Le Mans, but hardly to be called
master of Maine, and assuredly not master of the Vexin,
stayed in Normandy during the winter which followed
the double war in those regions. The time of his absence
is spoken of as a time of special oppression in
England, a time when the exactions of Flambard and
his fellows grew worse and worse, on account of the
great sums which had to be sent over the sea for the
King’s wars.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_622" id="fnanchor_622"></a><a href="#footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></span>

<p><span class="sni">Buildings of William Rufus.</span>
The architectural works of William Rufus form a
marked feature in his reign; but the place which they
hold in the national annals is singular.
They are set
down among the grievances of that unhappy time. <span class="sni">They are reckoned among national grievances.</span> Besides
the bad weather, which was not the Red King’s
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">258</span>
fault, and the bad harvests which were deemed to be
in some measure his fault,
there were the unrighteous
taxes and the other forms of unlaw which were directly
his fault; <span class="sni">Various grievances.</span> lastly there were the great buildings which
are set down as not the least among his ways of oppressing
the people. <span class="sni">Complaints in 1096,</span>
We have heard some of the wails
which the Chronicler sends up year by year. The year
of the purchase of Normandy was a year when the land
was pressed down by manifold gelds and by a heavy
time of hunger.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_624" id="fnanchor_624"></a><a href="#footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></span>
<span class="sni">in 1097.</span>
The next year, the year of Anselm’s
going, was a year of signs in the heavens, and of <em>ungelds</em>
and <em>unweather</em> below.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_625" id="fnanchor_625"></a><a href="#footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Signs and wonders in 1098.</span>
The next year, the year of
Maine, the year of the Vexin, the year of Anglesey, had
also its physical wonders. In the summer a pool at
Finchampstead in Berkshire was said to have welled up
blood.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_626" id="fnanchor_626"></a><a href="#footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></span>
At Michaelmas the heaven seemed well-nigh all
night as if it were burning.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_627" id="fnanchor_627"></a><a href="#footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Bad weather of 1098.</span>
That was a very grievous
year, through manifold <em>ungeld</em> and through mickle rains
that all the year never stopped; and&mdash;&#8203;what came home
to those who could look back to the bright days of the
Golden Borough&mdash;&#8203;well-nigh all tilth in the marsh-land
died out.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_628" id="fnanchor_628"></a><a href="#footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The great buildings in London. 1097.</span>
Such are the mournful voices to which we
listen year by year; but in the central year of the three
another grievance is added. “Eke many shires that
with work to London belonged were sorely harassed
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pageno">259</span>
through the wall that they wrought around the Tower,
and through the bridge that well nigh all flooded
away was, and through the King’s hall-work that
man in Westminster wrought, and many men therewith
harassed.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_629" id="fnanchor_629"></a><a href="#footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the light in which three great works of
building on which Englishmen of later days learned to
look with national pride were looked on by the men
of the time when they were wrought. We hear the
cry of the Hebrew in the brick-field toiling to rear up
the treasure-cities of the Pharaohs. <span class="sni">Earlier parallels.</span>
We hear the cry of
the Roman plebeian, as the proud Tarquin constrained
him to give the sweat of his brow to fence in the seven
hills with walls or to burrow beneath the ground to lay
the foundations and turn the arches of the great sewer.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_630" id="fnanchor_630"></a><a href="#footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></span>
So it was in the days of the Red King with the Tower of
London, the bridge of London, the hall of Westminster.
<span class="sni">Abuse of the old law.</span>
We may believe that, as so often happened, the old
law of England was turned to purposes of oppression.
The repair of bridges and fortresses was the universal
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
burthen on the Englishman’s <em>eðel</em>, the duty which he
owed, not to a personal lord, but to the commonwealth
of which he was a member.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_631" id="fnanchor_631"></a><a href="#footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></span>
In one case at
least we know that the defences of the local capital
were laid by local law upon the people of the whole
shire.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_632" id="fnanchor_632"></a><a href="#footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></span>
What was law at Chester would seem from the
words of the Chronicler to have been law in London
also. There were certain “shires that with work to
London belonged.” William Rufus may therefore have
been quite within the letter of the ancient law in calling
on the people of certain shires to contribute in money or
labour to any works which were needed for either the
Tower or the bridge of London. But it is clear that
this is the kind of law which opens the way to a great
amount of oppression in detail, and that the law itself
supplies temptations to extort more than the law gives.
<span class="sni">The bridge and the Tower.</span>
The bridge at least was an useful work, and if the men
of London thought that the Tower stood by their walls
rather to overawe them than to defend them, that was
an argument which could not be openly brought forward.
<span class="sni">Question as to the hall.</span>
But it is by no means clear whether the ancient
law about bridges and fortresses could be stretched so as
to take in works at the King’s palace. Anyhow the
burthen laid on the people was frightfully oppressive, and
those who felt the burthen bitterly complained. And, if
we rightly understand the Chronicler, the grievance of
building the bridge was doubled by a flood which swept
away the unfinished work, and made it needful to build
it over again.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_633" id="fnanchor_633"></a><a href="#footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, amid the toils and groans of the people, three
mighty works arose, to hand down the name of William
Rufus to after ages as a great builder. While Rufus
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">261</span>
was harrying the land of Maine, a land which but for
him might have remained peaceful and happy under a
righteous ruler, while he was striving in vain to bring
the heights of Chaumont and Montfort under his power,
the people of a large part of England were giving their
strength and their money to make London put on a
new face, to make all things ready for the time when
the King should again come to his island kingdom to
wear his crown in or hard by its greatest city. <span class="sni">Growth of the greatness of London.</span>
All
these works point, among other things, to the steady
growth of the greatness of London. The city had
grown fast in importance during the whole century
which was now drawing to an end, and at no time
faster than during Harold’s nine months of little stillness.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_634" id="fnanchor_634"></a><a href="#footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Relations of London and Winchester.</span>
London had become the city of the King; Winchester
was left to be the city of the Old Lady.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_635" id="fnanchor_635"></a><a href="#footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></span>
The
attractions of the New Forest drew the Conqueror,
specially after the death of Eadgyth, back again to the
old West-Saxon capital; but this preference of Winchester
as the head-quarters of sport in no way checked
the advance of London as the real head of the kingdom.
Harsh as may have been the means by which the Red
King raised his great buildings, richly as he and they
may have earned the curses of his subjects at the time,
we can say nothing against either the taste or the policy
which led him to the defence and the adornment of
the great city and of the palace which lay under its
shadow.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The wall round the Tower.</span>
Notwithstanding any momentary checks, the works
went on and prospered. The great tower of Gundulf&mdash;&#8203;strange
work for the meek follower of Anselm&mdash;&#8203;was
fenced in with a surrounding wall. <span class="sni">London Bridge.</span>
The river was
spanned by its first stone bridge, that long range of
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
narrow arches, itself a thickly-peopled city over the
stream, of which the last traces vanished in our own
early days. <span class="sni">Westminster Hall.</span>
But above all there now arose that famous
hall of Westminster whose name has come to be another
name for the law of England. Strange founder for
such a pile might seem the prince whose reign was before
all others the reign of unlaw. <span class="sni">Its two founders.</span>
And yet it was not
wholly unfitting that the Prytaneion of England should
first arise at the bidding of William the Red, and
should take a new form at the bidding of a later
king in whose days unlaw was again mighty. <span class="sni">Its architecture.</span>
The
great hall arose at the bidding of Rufus, in the stern
and solemn form of the art of his day&mdash;&#8203;the day, be it
remembered, of William of Saint-Calais and the choir
of Durham&mdash;&#8203;with its low massive walls, its two ranges
of pillars and arches, far removed, we may be sure, from
the graceful forms which had been at Spalato and which
were to be again at Oakham, but standing firm in their
strength, bearing the full impress of the style whose
leading feature is that of simple, changeless, abiding,
rest.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_636" id="fnanchor_636"></a><a href="#footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Recasting by Richard the Second.</span>
At the bidding of Richard of Bourdeaux the walls
were cased, and pierced with windows of forms unknown
in the days of the Red King; his pillars and
arches were swept away; the central space and its aisles
were thrown into a single body; the timber roof of
wondrous span and wondrous workmanship leaped
boldly from wall to wall, with a daring which might
have pleased the swelling pride of Rufus himself. Thus,
at the word of two despotic kings, arose the pile which
may claim, no less than its neighbours, Saint Peter’s
chapter-house and Saint Stephen’s chapel, to be the chosen
home of English freedom. For in England law has ever
grown out of unlaw. The despotism of Normans and of
Tudors only paved the way for the outbursts of freedom in
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">263</span>
the thirteenth century and in the seventeenth; a reforming
Henry dogged the steps alike of Rufus and of Richard.
<span class="sni">Legal position of the reign of Rufus.</span>
And if from one side the reign of Rufus was a reign of
unlaw, from another side it was a reign of overmuch
law. It saw the beginning of those legal subtleties, that
web woven by the wicked skill of Flambard, which
makes the Red King’s day a marked epoch in legal
history. His reign bridges the space between the days
when we had laws but when we had no lawyers, and
the days when lawyers had grown so many and so
subtle that the true ends of law were sometimes forgotten
among them. <span class="sni">History of the hall.</span>
If from one side the hall of Westminster
has been one of the cradles of English freedom,
from another side it has been the special home of that
form of unlaw by which men have been sent to a wrongful
doom under the outward forms of justice. Of all
that is good and bad in the history of the law of
England the hall of Rufus is the material embodying.
Within no other building reared by the hand of man
has so great a share of English history been wrought.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Object of the hall.</span>
But it was not directly as the dwelling-place either of
law or of its opposite that Rufus first reared his hall.
It was built rather as a trophy of his own swelling pride.
<span class="sni">Personal pride of Rufus.</span>
The home of the Confessor, the home of the Conqueror,
was not stately enough for the Red King. He would be
lodged, at least in that special home of kingship, as
better became the idea which he had formed of his own
greatness. It was the hall of the king, rather than the
hall of the kingdom, the centre and crown of his own
house, the place for the display of his own splendour,
which Rufus sought to call into being. <span class="sni">Legends of the hall.</span>
When the
work was done, other men deemed that it was as great,
perhaps greater, than even so great a king could need.
But its founder was not satisfied. Nero, when he had
finished his Golden House, allowed that he was at last
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>
lodged like a man. Rufus, when he had outdone the
works of all that had gone before him, hardly deemed
that he was lodged like a man in his palace of Westminster.
<span class="sni">Alleged sayings of Rufus.</span>
The new hall, when it was done, was not half
so great as he had meant it to be.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_637" id="fnanchor_637"></a><a href="#footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></span>
Some add a wilder
saying, that he would build a house on such a scale that
the great hall should be but one of its bed-chambers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_638" id="fnanchor_638"></a><a href="#footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></span>
But the hall, such as it was, vast in the eyes of other
men, small in the eyes of its master, was ready for use
by the day of the Pentecostal feast. <span class="sni">The Whitsun feast.</span>
Then the assembly
came together; then the accustomed rites were gone
through in the West Minster; then the banquet and
the council were held, as was wont, under its shadow,
in the accustomed place, but within new walls and under
a new roof. Within those walls, beneath that roof, men
for the first time saw King William of England, lord, as
he deemed, of Scotland, Normandy, and Maine, in all his
own greatness and glory, in all the greatness and glory
of his new work. One feature in that great gathering
might indeed have helped to swell his heart even higher
than it had ever before been swollen. The crown was,
as usual, placed on his head in the minster and worn in
the hall. And on that day at least he must have felt
that the crown which was placed on his head was in
truth an imperial diadem. William the Red was not
indeed rowed on the Thames by vassal kings, like
Eadgar the Giver-of-peace. But in the pomps of that
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
day he saw a king march before him as his vassal,
a king who had received his crown at his own bidding.
<span class="sni">The sword borne by the King of Scots.</span>
When King William of England wore his <em>cynehelm</em> in
church and hall, King Eadgar of Scotland, first of his
men in rank and honour, bore the sword of state before
his lord.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_639" id="fnanchor_639"></a><a href="#footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></span>
Was that day of pride and pomp merely a
day of pride and pomp, or were any of the great affairs
of William’s kingdom and empire dealt with in the joint
presence of the Monarch of Britain and his kingly
vassal? One thing only we know; one act alone of
that gathering is recorded. But that act is one which
has no small fitness as the one act which we know that
the Red King did in his new building.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Deaths of bishops and abbots.</span>
The hands of Randolf Flambard must have been just
then full of work, and the coffers of King William must
have been just then well filled with wealth flowing in
from the usual sources. Bishops and abbots had for some
time been dying most conveniently for the King and his
minister. <span class="sni">Walkelin of Winchester. January 3, 1098.</span>

Anselm, knew that he could raise no such sum without
robbery of the Church and oppression of the poor. He
prayed that he might be set free from a world of
which he was weary. Two days later his prayer was
answered; while the Red King warred at Chaumont

England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_648" id="fnanchor_648"></a><a href="#footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></span></p>

<p>On the death of Bishop Walkelin presently followed
the deaths of two other heads of great monastic bodies.
<span class="sni">Death of Turold of Peterborough, and of Robert of New Minster.</span>

another great abbot passed away who was, in a

earlier days. <span class="sni">Death of Baldwin of Saint Eadmund’s. December 29, 1097.</span>
Abbot Baldwin of Saint Eadmund’s, the
skilful leech of King Eadward, if not himself of English
birth, had at least received his staff from an English
King. His house had been growing in wealth and fame
ever since the penitent devotion of Cnut had changed
the secular canons of Beadricsworth into the monks of
Saint Eadmund’s. We have already heard of Baldwin’s

The latest
research has added largely to our knowledge of Baldwin
and his house, and has brought to light several details
which illustrate the reign of the Red King and the
characters of some of the chief actors in it.
<span class="sni">Miracles of Saint Eadmund.</span>
Saint Eadmund had long ago begun to work signs and wonders.
In King Eadward’s day he had avenged himself
on our old friend Osgod Clapa, <span class="sni">Osgod Clapa.</span>
reverenced at Waltham
but not reverenced at Saint Eadmund’s, because he had
thrust himself into the holy place with his Danish axe
in warlike guise on his shoulder.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_653" id="fnanchor_653"></a><a href="#footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Bishop Herfast.</span>
In the days of the
elder William, when the dispute was going on between
the abbey and the bishopric, the saint had directly interfered
to bring Bishop Herfast to a better mind by a
bodily chastisement.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_654" id="fnanchor_654"></a><a href="#footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></span>
He had even appeared, as he had
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
done to the tyrant Swegen,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_655" id="fnanchor_655"></a><a href="#footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></span>
mounted and lance in hand,
to smite, and in smiting to reform, a courtier of the Conqueror’s,
Randolf by name.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_656" id="fnanchor_656"></a><a href="#footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></span>
But we are more concerned
with stories which directly bear on our own history.
<span class="sni">Robert of Curzon.</span>
When Roger Bigod did so much evil in eastern England
in the days of the general rebellion, Saint Eadmund
did not fail to defend his own lands, and to smite with
madness a certain Robert of Curzon to whom the rebel
had presumed to grant a manor belonging to the abbey.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_657" id="fnanchor_657"></a><a href="#footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Completion of the Church. 1094.
The King forbids the dedication.</span>
We read too how, when the new church was finished,
King William, seemingly in the assembly at Hastings,
by what caprice is not explained, gave permission for
the translation of the martyr, but forbade the dedication
of the church.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_658" id="fnanchor_658"></a><a href="#footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></span>
Meanwhile, a rumour, of which we have

Abbot Baldwin
survived this triumph two years and a half. His
career had been a long and a busy one. In the course of
his warfare with the East-Anglian bishops, he had found
it needful to visit Rome, and he too, like others, found
how great was the strength of gold and silver at the
threshold of the Apostles.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_660" id="fnanchor_660"></a><a href="#footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></span>

<p>We cannot, as these stories alone show, go very far in
the reign of Rufus without coming across the name of
Randolf Flambard, chaplain and Justiciar. We are now
about to hear of him in a new character. The churches
of the prelates who so opportunely died, remained unfilled;
their temporalities passed into the King’s hands;
their revenues were to be gathered in, their tenants were
to be squeezed as might be needful, by the zealous care
of the faithful Randolf. <span class="sni">Vacancy of Durham.</span>
But one church, of higher dignity
than all these, which had stood vacant longer than
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pageno">271</span>
all these, was at last to have a shepherd. The careful
guardian of them all was at last to have his reward.
The reward was a great one, but in the course of his
long service he had doubtless gathered enough into his
private hoard to pay the price even for such a gift. <span class="sni">The bishopric granted to Flambard.</span>
The
hall was built; the Witan were assembled in it; and, as
the one recorded act of the assembly, the King gave the
bishopric of Durham to Randolf his chaplain, that ere
drave all his gemóts over all England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_662" id="fnanchor_662"></a><a href="#footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></span>
In the new hall
of Westminster, the hall of justice, often the hall of injustice,
the man who had wrought so much of real injustice,
but who had raised the name of justice, in its
official meaning, to the high place which it has ever after
kept&mdash;&#8203;the Justiciar Randolf Flambard, the founder of
the greatness of his office, the creator of the feudal law
of England&mdash;&#8203;received one of the greatest of the prizes to
which men of his class could look forward. The driver
of gemóts, the <dfn>exactor</dfn> of the moneys of rich and poor,
became, not only lord of strong castles and of barons
and knights not a few, but also shepherd of souls in a
great diocese, abbot of monks in a monastery too young
as yet to have wholly lost its first love. <span class="sni">Consecration of Flambard. June 5, 1099.</span>
The new successor
of Saint Cuthberht, Randolf Bishop of Durham,
was presently consecrated in Saint Paul’s minster by his
metropolitan Archbishop Thomas. But the local patriotism
of Durham takes care to put on record that, as
his predecessor William of Saint-Calais had made no
profession, so neither did he.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_663" id="fnanchor_663"></a><a href="#footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Character of the appointment.</span>
The appointment of Randolf Flambard to a great
<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
bishopric, as it is the last recorded kingly act of Rufus
in England, was the crowning act of that abuse of the
royal power in ecclesiastical matters, that bringing low
of the Church and her ministers, which is so marked a
feature of his reign.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_664" id="fnanchor_664"></a><a href="#footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></span>
To place the bishop’s staff in the
hands of Randolf Flambard was going a step further than
to place it in the hands of Robert Bloet. <span class="sni">Flambard’s episcopate. 1099&ndash;1128. His works at Durham.</span>
Yet Flambard
showed himself in some ways, in all temporal ways, as a
great prelate. A mighty builder, he joined his efforts with
those of his monks to carry on Saint Cuthberht’s abbey
on a plan as noble as that on which William of Saint-Calais
had begun it, and with greater richness of detail.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_665" id="fnanchor_665"></a><a href="#footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></span>
He strengthened the fortifications of his castle and city;
he laid out the green between the castle and the abbey.
<span class="sni">The castle of Norham. 1121.</span>
At the extreme border of what was now the English
kingdom, not on the extreme border of his own diocese,
he founded the famous castle of Norham. It was built,
we are told, as a defence alike against border thieves
and against attacks of invading Scots.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_666" id="fnanchor_666"></a><a href="#footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></span>
But this last
<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pageno">273</span>
motive was hardly needed in the days of Eadgar, Alexander,
and David. Every temporal right of his church
he defended to the uttermost.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_667" id="fnanchor_667"></a><a href="#footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His personal character.</span>
Still eager to be first,
pretending with voice and gesture more of wrath than
he really felt, we see in the mighty Bishop of Durham
essentially the same man as the royal officer who made
sad the enthronization day of Anselm.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_668" id="fnanchor_668"></a><a href="#footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></span>
As to his life
and conversation strange tales are told. The Bishop is
said to have wantonly exposed his monks to temptations
most contrary to monastic rule, to have entertained them
in the episcopal hall along with guests most unbecoming
for an episcopal castle, and to have marked as hypocrites
all who refused to join in his unseemly revelries.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_669" id="fnanchor_669"></a><a href="#footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></span>
But
the mass of Flambard’s doings as bishop, good or bad,
belong to the reign of Henry, to his own second episcopate.
<span class="sni">1106?-1128.</span>
Our own story will show him, after a short
occupation of his see, an exile, an exile after the type
of William of Saint-Calais rather than after the type of
Anselm. From that exile he came back, as his predecessor
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pageno">274</span>
came back, to go on with his great work, to rule, with
unabated strength of mind and body, to extreme old
age, and to die with every sign of penitence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_670" id="fnanchor_670"></a><a href="#footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></span></p>

<p>The appointment of Flambard is the last recorded act
of the Red King on English ground. We take leave of
him, as far as the affairs of our own country are concerned,
in the new hall of Westminster, placing the bishop’s staff
in a hand which doubtless grasped it more readily than
the hand of Anselm. <span class="sni">Later events of the year. 1099.</span>
But we have still to see somewhat
of him in two other characters, in either of which he was
more at home than in that of the civil ruler. We have
to look at him as the hunter and as the warrior. From
the great ceremony at Westminster he seems to have
straightway taken himself to enjoy the sports of the
woods in Wiltshire. The prince who ruled on both
sides of the channel had come back to his island realm
to busy himself both with English affairs and with English
pleasures. While thus engaged, his thoughts were
once more suddenly called to matters beyond the sea.</p>

<p class="p2 center">§ 5. <span class="title">The Second War of Maine.</span><br />
<i>April-September 1099.</i></p>

<p>In the August of the last year William had given
Helias of Maine his full leave to do what he could
against him, reserving doubtless to himself the like
power to do what he could against Helias. <span class="sni">Action of Helias. August, 1098-April 1099.</span>
In the
months which had since passed the Count of Maine had
shown that he could do a good deal; but it seemingly
was not till he had shown the full range of his powers
of doing that the King felt himself called on once more
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pageno">275</span>
to try his own powers against him. William did not
stir himself till the news came that Helias was again in
Le Mans, and then he stirred himself indeed. <span class="sni">August, 1098.</span>
Helias,
when he was set free in August, went at once to his
own immediate possessions on the border of Maine and
Anjou. <span class="sni">Helias withdraws to La Flèche.</span>
If he was no longer Count of Maine, he was
still lord of La Flèche. If he could no longer reign on
the Cenomannian height, in the palace on the Roman
wall or in the tower before whose rising strength the
Roman wall itself had given way, he could at least keep
his own native town and castle. <span class="sni">He strengthens the castles on the Loir.</span>
At La Flèche, and
in the whole southern part of the county, Helias still
reigned, undisputed and unthreatened. He was still
lord of the whole line of fortresses which guarded the
course of the Loir, the tributary of the greater stream
with which its name is so easily confounded. The
castles along that river, reared doubtless to guard the
Cenomannian border against attacks from the south,
served, now that things had so strangely turned about,
to protect the southern districts of Maine against attacks
from its own capital. In front of the land to be guarded
stood the castles of Mayet and Outillé. Along the Loir
itself stood a formidable line of defences; La Chartre
guarded one end, La Flèche the other; between them lay
La Lude and the fortress which is still specially known as
the Castle of the Loir. <span class="sni">La Chartre.</span>
The stream flows below the hill-fort
of La Chartre, once held by Geoffrey of Mayenne,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_671" id="fnanchor_671"></a><a href="#footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></span>
but the name of this castle is not mentioned in our
present story. The omission is singular, as La Chartre
must always have been a post of special importance,
guarding Maine towards the land of Chartres as well as
towards the now Angevin land of Tours. It rises, like
Bellême and Saint Cenery, on the bluff of a promontory
where two mounds with their fosses mark the site of the
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pageno">276</span>
fortress, and where the rocky sides of the hill are
pierced, like the hill of Nottingham, like so many hills
along the greater Loire, with the dwelling-places of man.
<span class="sni">La Flèche.</span>
Much lower down the Loir is Helias’ own special home
of La Flèche, where all traces of his day have vanished,
but where the castle of John and Paula must have stood,
on a site most unlike that of La Chartre, on one of the
rich and grassy islands which are there formed by the
branching of the stream. <span class="sni">Château-du-Loir.</span>
Château-du-Loir lies between
the two, and the river from which it takes its name is a
far less prominent feature there than at either La Flèche
or La Chartre. The fortress which is specially called the
Castle of the Loir stands at a greater distance from its
waters than either of the other two. But of the stronghold
itself it has more to show than either. The castle stands
half-hidden in the midst of the small modern town, and
the approaches to it have been carefully defaced and
levelled. But the stump of a tower of irregular shape
still remains, which may well be a fragment of the
stronghold of Helias; the neighbouring church too
still keeps under its choir a crypt which must be far
older than his day. Still in possession of a considerable
part of his dominions, master of a district so strongly
guarded, the undisputed lord of La Flèche began to
make everything ready for a campaign which might
make him once more Count of Le Mans. <span class="sni">Preparations of Helias. August 1098-April 1099.</span>
From August
till April, Helias kept within his own lands&mdash;&#8203;like a bull
in the hiding-places of the woods, says the local writer<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_672" id="fnanchor_672"></a><a href="#footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;strengthening
his own fortresses and making alliances
wherever he could. <span class="sni">April 10, 1099.</span>
The whole line of castles, together
with the fortified villages in the neighbourhood, had by
Easter-tide been made ready for defence against the
attacks of any enemy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_673" id="fnanchor_673"></a><a href="#footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">277</span>
Helias now deemed that the time was come for offensive
operations against the invaders of Maine. <span class="sni">Helias begins operations.</span>
He began to
attack the posts which were occupied by the King’s
forces, and to lay waste the lands in their possession.
In this work he was secretly favoured by the people of
the country,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_674" id="fnanchor_674"></a><a href="#footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></span>
and before long a large body of his friends
and neighbours had openly joined his banner. <span class="sni">He marches against Le Mans. June, 1099.</span>
In June
he set forth at the head of a great force for an enterprise
against the city itself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_675" id="fnanchor_675"></a><a href="#footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></span>
We should like to know what,
in such a case, was deemed a great force; but we may
suspect that the following of Helias would largely consist
of irregular levies, not well fitted, unless with the advantage
of very superior numbers, to measure themselves
with the picked and tried mercenaries of Rufus. The
army marched northwards towards Le Mans. <span class="sni">Junction of Sarthe and Huisne.</span>
A little
to the south-west of the city the Sarthe is joined by the
Huisne, the stream which, with its tributaries, waters
the whole north-eastern part of Maine. The river is at
this point shallow and weedy, with woody banks and
small islands in its bed. Two old lines of road lead
from the south towards the lower course of the Huisne.
One leads towards the bridge of Pontlieue, a bridge
<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pageno">278</span>
which has a history in modern times.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_676" id="fnanchor_676"></a><a href="#footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></span>
The other leads
to a ford less than a mile lower down the stream, now
known as the ford of Mauny. One of our accounts distinctly
makes Helias cross by a ford; the other seems
less distinctly to imply that he crossed by a bridge.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_677" id="fnanchor_677"></a><a href="#footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></span>
At
any rate he crossed in this quarter, immediately south
of Le Mans. <span class="sni">Battle at Pontlieue.</span>
He challenged the King’s troops in the
city to come forth. The challenge was accepted, and a
battle followed on the ground between the Huisne and
the city. Pontlieue may now pass as a suburb of Le
Mans, and not its least busy suburb. In those days the
flat ground was doubtless all open; the hospital reared
by Henry the Second in the neighbourhood of his native
city must have been placed there as in a rural retreat.
<span class="sni">Victory of Helias; he recovers Le Mans.</span>
The fight was stout; the King’s troops fought valiantly;
but they were put to flight by the greater numbers of
the liberating host. The beaten garrison sought shelter
in the city; fliers and pursuers streamed in together;
the gates could not be shut; Count Helias was again in
Le Mans at the head of a conquering army.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_678" id="fnanchor_678"></a><a href="#footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">279</span>
<span class="sni">Joy of the citizens.</span>
The joy of the citizens of Le Mans was indeed great
at his coming.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_679" id="fnanchor_679"></a><a href="#footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></span>
Their own lord, their native count, the
happiness of whose former reign they remembered in its
fair contrast with the Norman dominion, was again
amongst his faithful people. The formal welcome which
had greeted the coming of Rufus was exchanged for heartfelt
delight at the coming of Helias. <span class="sni">The castles still held for Rufus.</span>
But there was still
work to be done. Helias was in Le Mans; but the
garrison of Rufus was in Le Mans also. The garrison
had not been able to hinder the Count’s followers from
entering the city; but the Count’s followers had not
been able to hinder the garrison from securing themselves
in the fortresses of the city, in the King’s tower
and in Mont-Barbet.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_680" id="fnanchor_680"></a><a href="#footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Comparison with the deliverance of York in 1069.</span>
And now the story reads almost
word for word like a famous scene in our own history
just thirty years before.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_681" id="fnanchor_681"></a><a href="#footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></span>
Helias entered Le Mans as
Eadgar and Waltheof entered York. And at Le Mans,
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">280</span>
as at York, the native deliverers occupied the city while
the foreign garrison still held the castles. The Normans
at Le Mans betook themselves to the same means of
defence as the Normans at York, the familiar means of
defence of their nation. Whether he would or not, the
joyous entry of Helias was to be celebrated with the
same kind of offerings as the crowning and the churching
of the Conqueror. Westminster, York, Mantes, had felt
the Norman power of destruction; the turn of Le Mans
was now come. <span class="sni">The Normans set fire to the city.</span>
Walter the son of Ansgar set his engineers
to work, and, when the evening came, flaming
brands and hot cinders were hurled from their engines
upon the houses of the city. It was summer; all things
were dry; a strong east wind was blowing, and all Le
Mans was presently in a blaze.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_682" id="fnanchor_682"></a><a href="#footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></span>
How the great minster,
so near to the King’s tower, escaped without damage
does not appear. But, as the church stands between the
castle and the main part of the city, we may conceive
that the fiery bolts launched by the engines from the
tower might fly over the roof of its nave without
doing harm. In any case, before the end of the day on
which Helias entered, a large part of the city and suburbs
was burned. The true prince was again in his own
city; but he had nothing there to reign over, except
smoking ruins commanded by a hostile fortress. <span class="sni">Discouragement of the citizens.</span>
And
we are told that the love of the citizens for their count
was somewhat lessened by this mischance of warfare,
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pageno">281</span>
which was surely no fault of his. We are significantly
told that they were less eager to fight for him in the
evening than they had been in the morning.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_683" id="fnanchor_683"></a><a href="#footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></span>
Wooden
houses indeed could easily be rebuilt; it may even be
that that day’s fire cleared the space for those noble
domestic buildings of a little later date, some of which
the official barbarism of our own day has deigned to
spare, and of which those that still remain count among
the choicest treasures of Le Mans.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_684" id="fnanchor_684"></a><a href="#footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></span>
But at the moment
the effect must have been disheartening, and the change
in the feelings of the people is in no way wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Operation against the castles.</span>
At Le Mans, as at York in the like case, the business
of the moment was the assault of the castles; but at Le
Mans the enterprise of the deliverers was less fortunate
than it had been at York. The citizens of Le Mans
were not, like the citizens of York, to have the pleasure
of breaking down the stronghold of the stranger. Helias
himself, after all, was a French prince of the eleventh
century, and he would hardly have been so ready as
Waltheof was to encourage such a work. He had never,
during his earlier reign, thought of playing Timoleôn
in that special fashion. But in any case the fortresses
were first to be taken. Walter the son of Ansgar seems
to have been a more wary captain than William Malet
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">282</span>
and Gilbert of Ghent. He did not risk a sally, and
Helias had not the same opportunity as Waltheof of
showing his personal prowess by cutting off Norman
heads in the gate.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_685" id="fnanchor_685"></a><a href="#footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The castles besieged in vain.</span>
He was driven to a formal siege of
the castle. Amid the ashes of the burned city he planted
his engines to play upon the royal tower. <span class="sni">Question of the church towers.</span>
We may
almost suspect, from a story which we shall come to
presently, that the new towers of Saint Julian’s were
profaned to warlike uses, and were made, as they well
might be, to play a part in the attack. But in any case
the attack was in vain. The strength of the fortresses,
the skill with which their defenders brought engines to
answer engines, were too great for all the battering-works
of Helias.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_686" id="fnanchor_686"></a><a href="#footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Robert of Bellême strengthens Ballon.</span>
The King’s tower and Mont Barbet
both held out, and Robert of Bellême took the further
precaution of strengthening the defences of Ballon.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_687" id="fnanchor_687"></a><a href="#footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">The news sent to the King.</span>
But it was not enough for the garrisons to hold out.
They served a master beyond the sea; and that master
had yet to learn either that they were holding out or
that there was any enemy for them to hold out against.
We are in this story doubtless dealing with the work of
a very few days. The fight by the ford, the entry of
Helias, and the fire, all took place on the same day. The
siege of the castles would begin at the first moment that
any engines could be brought up. Whether Helias had
brought them with him, or whether he had to send for
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">283</span>
them, we are not told. We may be sure that there
was no great delay in sending the news to the
King; but the messenger did not start till he had
something more to tell than that Le Mans, or what
was left of it, was in the hands of its own count.
A Norman Pheidippidês, Amalchis by name, the special
courier of Robert of Bellême, was sent with the
news.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_688" id="fnanchor_688"></a><a href="#footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The news brought to him in the New Forest.</span>
He crossed the sea; he hastened to the King’s
hunting-seat of Clarendon, and met William and a party
of his favourite companions going forth to hunt in the
New Forest. The King asked the messenger what the
news was. The news was speedily told; Le Mans was
taken by treason. But Amalchis could add some words
of comfort, how his own lord held Ballon, how the King’s
troops in the city, though besieged and attacked by the
enemy, still held out in the fortresses, how they were
longing for the King to come in person to their help.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_689" id="fnanchor_689"></a><a href="#footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></span>
We can hardly believe that Rufus had heard nothing
of the general movements of Helias in southern Maine;
but all that had happened since the Count set forth for
Pontlieue came to his ears in a single message.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">William rides to the coast.</span>
At the hearing of such a tale as this William the Red
did not tarry. He waited for no counsellors. His words
were only, “Let us go beyond the sea and help our friends.”
When those around him bade him wait till a force could
be made ready, he answered, “I will see who will follow
me. Do you think that I shall be left without men?
I know well the youth of my lands, they will hasten to
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pageno">284</span>
come to me, even at the risk of shipwreck.” So saying,
without following, without preparation, he loosened his
bridle, he put spurs to his horse, he rode straight to the
sea-shore at Southampton, and at once trusted himself
all alone to an old crazy ship which he found there.
<span class="sni">He crosses to Touques.</span>
The sky was cloudy; the wind was contrary; the blasts
tossed up huge waves; the sailors prayed him to wait
till the winds and the waves should be more inclined to
peace and mercy. “I never heard of a king being
drowned,” cried Rufus; “make haste, loose your cables;
you will see the elements join to obey me.” He set sail,
and the next morning he reached the haven of Touques,
God, we are told by the monk of Saint Evroul, being his
guide.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_690" id="fnanchor_690"></a><a href="#footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></span></p>

<p>The spot where William landed must, especially at the
moment of William’s landing, have had a widely different
look from that which it bears in our own day. <span class="sni">Touques in Rufus’ time.</span>
The river
from which the town of Touques takes its name, flowing
down from Lisieux to its mouth by the modern pleasure-town
of Trouville, has had its course shifted by modern
improvements; but it has perhaps not greatly changed
in width or bulk of stream since the time of our story.
Touques lies a few miles inland; but a high tide would
easily bring up the small vessels of that day to the point
which was once a busy haven, but which now affords at
the most a landing-place for barges. The single long
street, full of picturesque wooden buildings of later times,
and containing a striking disused church of the days of
Rufus or his father, now turns away from the stream, as if
to show that the days of Touques as a haven have passed
away. In those days the inland port, placed in the rich
vale of the stream, under the shadow of the hills, those
to the right forming the forest-land of Touques, was a
frequented spot; and at the moment when the ship came
<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
which bore Rufus and his fortunes, it presented a busy
scene. <span class="sni">Landing of the King.</span>
As was usual in the summer-tide, a crowd of
persons, both clerical and lay, was gathered at the riverside.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_691" id="fnanchor_691"></a><a href="#footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></span>
When they saw a ship coming from England,
they pressed to ask what the news might be. Specially
they asked how the King fared. And lo, the King was
there as his own messenger to answer them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_692" id="fnanchor_692"></a><a href="#footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></span>
He returned
their greetings in merry mood, and all wondered
and were glad.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_693" id="fnanchor_693"></a><a href="#footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></span>
We must remember that Normandy had
better reason to be glad at the presence of Rufus than
either England or Maine. <span class="sni">His ride to Bonneville.</span>
The King landed; he sprang
on the first beast that he could find, a mare belonging
to a priest, and so took the road which led towards
the south-east to the castle of Bonneville, on the slope
of the hills which overlook and guard the haven. The
distance is short, and most of it is uphill, and the speed
of the priest’s mare was most likely not equal to the
speed of the King’s own horse which had borne him
from Clarendon to Southampton. A loyal crowd, clerks
and peasants, were thus able to follow him on foot,
cheering their sovereign as he rode up the hill-side to
the castle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_694" id="fnanchor_694"></a><a href="#footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">The castle of Bonneville.</span>
The headlong rush by land and sea was now over, and
the Red King again found himself in one of the chief
strongholds of Normandy. The castle of Bonneville,
placed, not on the top of the hill, but on a small spur
projecting from its side, was in fact the citadel of
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">286</span>
Touques. It specially guarded the inland haven; otherwise
one might rather have looked for the site of such
a fortress on the hills which overlook the sea and guard
the actual mouth of the stream. Yet from the towers of
Bonneville we look out on a wide and a goodly prospect.
Almost at the foot of the hill lies Touques itself. The
river stretches away to its mouth at Deauville; on the
right the valley is fenced in by the high ground of the
forest, on the left by the hill crowned by the castle of
Lassay, famous in later times, with the small priory of
Saint Arnold, still keeping work of the Conqueror’s day,
nestling on the hill-side. But at Bonneville itself no
strictly architectural work remains which can have served
the Red King as a resting-place after his fierce journey.
The existing castle, a shell-keep strengthened by round
towers, seems to be in all parts later than the days of
Rufus, later than the days of Norman independence. A
single gateway only could possibly be placed even within
the latter years of the twelfth century. But the site is an
ancient one; the castle is girded by a ditch, and the ditch
is in some parts further strengthened by an embankment,
which seem more likely to have been taken advantage
of by the Norman dukes than to be their original
work. <span class="sni">Early history and legends of Bonneville.</span>
Bonneville had been one of the dwelling-places
of William the Great, and it is one of the many towns
and castles which claim to have been the scene of the
oath of Harold.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_695" id="fnanchor_695"></a><a href="#footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></span>
Though the existing buildings are
later, the hill itself and its earthworks are there, as when
Rufus drew breath among them. He there rested for a
moment, after being borne with the swiftest speed of his
own age from the sports of the West-Saxon forest to the
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
serious business which pressed on a ruler of Normandy
when Le Mans was again held by a hostile power.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">William at Bonneville.</span>
The castle which Rufus had now reached, the nearest
fortress in Normandy to the spot in England from which
he had so wildly rushed, now became the starting-point
of a campaign which, in its beginning, was not unskilfully
planned. At Bonneville the King began to make
his preparations for the recovery of Le Mans. <span class="sni">His levy.</span>
He sent
his messengers to and fro, and soon gathered a large force.
<span class="sni">He marches towards Le Mans.</span>
He then began his march southward; he crossed the
frontier, and pressed on towards Le Mans, harrying the
land as he went.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_696" id="fnanchor_696"></a><a href="#footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></span>
The effect of his coming was immediate.
When the news came that the King was on his
way, the forces of Helias began to fail him; he no longer
dared to go on with the siege of the castles; he no longer
dared even to hold the city.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_697" id="fnanchor_697"></a><a href="#footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Helias flees to Château-du-Loir.</span>
He fled from Le Mans, and
hastened to the defence of his immediate possessions in
the southern part of the county. Here he took up his
head-quarters in his own fortress specially known as the
Castle of the Loir. Within its walls the Count of Maine
again waited for better days, while the hosts of Normandy
drew near to his capital.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_698" id="fnanchor_698"></a><a href="#footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Flight of the citizens.</span>
Meanwhile despair reigned in Le Mans. A crowd of
the citizens, with their wives and children and all that
<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
they had, followed their prince.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_699" id="fnanchor_699"></a><a href="#footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></span>
When Rufus heard of
the flight of Helias, he was still north of Le Mans.<span class="sni">William passes through Le Mans.</span>
He
pressed on to overtake his enemy; he reached the city;
but, like Harold on the march to Stamfordbridge, he did
not deem it a time to tarry even a single night within
its walls. And in the mind of Rufus there was doubtless
another motive at work besides either military precaution
or even simple military ardour. With him it
would be a point of honour to occupy, at the first moment
that he could, the ground on which his choice
troops had been put to flight by the hasty levies of
Helias. <span class="sni">His camp beyond the Huisne.</span>
He marched through the city, over the battleground
of Pontlieue; he crossed the bridge of the
Huisne, and pitched his camp on the broad plain<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_700" id="fnanchor_700"></a><a href="#footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></span>
to the
south of the stream. He had thus passed into what
might seem the immediate dominions of his rival, as his
rival had passed at the same point to attack the city
which he claimed as specially his own.</p>

<p><span class="sni">He harries southern Maine. Helias burns the castles.</span>
From his camp on the left back of the Huisne Rufus
began a deliberate and fearful harrying of the whole
southern part of Maine. But before his troops could
reach the strongholds of the enemy, they found the land
laid waste before them. Even two castles, those of
Outillé and Vaux-en-Belin,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_701" id="fnanchor_701"></a><a href="#footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></span>
were set fire to by the
<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pageno">289</span>
Count’s own partisans. Robert of Montfort&mdash;&#8203;the Norman
Montfort&mdash;&#8203;pressed on with five hundred knights,
put out the fire at Vaux, repaired the fortress, and held
it for the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_702" id="fnanchor_702"></a><a href="#footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></span>
Helias meanwhile was biding his time
in the Castle of the Loir. <span class="sni">Helias keeps on the defensive.</span>
His force was still strong;
but he deemed it no time for any attack on his part.
Perhaps he knew Rufus well enough to feel sure that
against him the tactics of Fabius were the tactics which
were most likely to prevail.</p>

<p>For in this campaign, exactly as in the earlier campaign
in Maine and in the campaign in the Vexin, the
thing which most strikes us is the way in which it
ends, or, more truly, the way in which it comes to no
end at all. <span class="sni">William besieges Mayet.</span>
While Helias held out at Château-du-Loir,
William, instead of attacking him, laid siege to Mayet.
At this last point, lying some way north of Château-du-Loir,
we find the scene of some of the most remarkable
anecdotes in our whole story, and it is here that the last
serious warfare of the Red King seems to have taken
place.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_703" id="fnanchor_703"></a><a href="#footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></span>
The siege was not a long one, and its result
was strange and unexpected; but the few days which it
took are crowded with incident, and they set William
Rufus before us in more than one character. He first
appears in a mood which may be thought wholly unexpected;
perhaps as touched by devotion himself, at all
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
events as hearkening readily to the devotional scruples
of others. The King’s host appeared before Mayet on a
Friday, and he gave orders for a general attack on the
castle on the next day.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_704" id="fnanchor_704"></a><a href="#footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Observance of the Truce of God.</span>
The sabbath morning dawns;
the warriors are vying with one another in girding on
their weapons and making ready for the attack.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_705" id="fnanchor_705"></a><a href="#footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></span>
Then
a pious scruple, a scruple which seems to have occurred to
no man on the day of Senlac, touched the hearts of some
of the elders of the host. Certain unrecorded wise men
crave of the King that, out of reverence for the Lord’s
burial and resurrection, he will spare the besieged both
that day and the next, and will grant them a truce till
Monday. In other words, they demand the observance
of the Truce of God.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_706" id="fnanchor_706"></a><a href="#footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></span>
The King gives glory to God,
and gives orders that it shall be as they wish; nothing
shall be done against the castle on either Saturday or
Sunday; on Monday the attack shall be made.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_707" id="fnanchor_707"></a><a href="#footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></span></p>

<p>We now get a glimpse within the walls. The defenders
of Mayet, we are told, were men of proved
valour and endurance, faithful to their lord and ready
to fight for him to the death.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_708" id="fnanchor_708"></a><a href="#footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></span>
It is worth notice that,
through the whole story, the Red King’s favourite arms
are never heard of within the bounds of Maine. <span class="sni">No bribery in Maine.</span>
The
wealth of England, which carried such weight within
Normandy and France, which proved such an unanswerable
<a name="line290_2" id="line290_2"></a>argument in the mind of King Philip, goes for nothing
on the banks of the Sarthe and the Loir. It seems
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
never to enter into any man’s mind that it was worth
trying to buy over any man who owned Helias as his
lord. So now in the Red King’s camp steel lies idle
on the holy days of the older and the newer law; and
gold seems to lie idle no less. <span class="sni">Preparations of the besieged.</span>
But those days were
not days of idleness within the bulwarks of Mayet.
The gallant defenders of the castle were making ready
for the attack. One special means of defence was to place
wicker crates along the walls in order to break the force
of the stones hurled by the King’s artillery.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_709" id="fnanchor_709"></a><a href="#footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The castle attacked on Monday.</span>
At last
Monday came, and the assault began. The deep and wide
ditch of the castle was found to be no small hindrance to
the besiegers.
A wild story is told that the King ordered
the ditch to be filled up with horses and mules, the beasts
seemingly of draught and burthen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_710" id="fnanchor_710"></a><a href="#footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></span>
 <span class="sni">Story of Robert of Bellême.</span> For them, as the
villains of the brute world, there was no mercy; the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">destrier</i> of the knight was, in knightly hearts, entitled to
some share of the respect due to his rider. But the tale
adds that Robert of Bellême, the man so hateful in Cenomannian
memory, improved on the King’s order, and
bade the ditch be filled, not only with horses, but with
human villains also.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_711" id="fnanchor_711"></a><a href="#footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></span>
Such an order would really be
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pageno">292</span>
thoroughly in the spirit of chivalry. <span class="sni">Illustrations of chivalry.</span>
It would have come
well from the mouths of those French gentlemen who
called at Crecy for the slaughter of the so-called peasants
whom they had hired from Genoa.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_712" id="fnanchor_712"></a><a href="#footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></span>
But William the Red
had learned beneath the walls of Rochester what the
churls of one land at least could do, and he was not
likely to carry his knightly ideal quite so far as this.
The tale, we may suspect, is a bit of local Cenomannian
romance, part of the popular tale of the devil of Mamers.
Those who tell it add that the effect of the order was to
cause the immediate flight of all the members of the
despised class who were within hearing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_713" id="fnanchor_713"></a><a href="#footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The besiegers fill the ditch with wood.</span>
But the most
trustworthy narrative of the siege of Mayet tells us nothing
of any of these strange ways of filling up a ditch.
There we read only of vast piles of wood which were
hurled into it, and of a path raised on piles which the
besiegers strove to make level with the palisade of the
castle.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The besieged burn the wood.</span>
But the devices of the garrison of Mayet were at least
equal to the devices of their enemies. They hurled down
masses of burning charcoal, and so, by the help of the
summer heat, they burned up the piles of wood with
which the besiegers were filling up the ditch.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_714" id="fnanchor_714"></a><a href="#footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></span>
All
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><span class="pageno">293</span>
Monday both sides strove with all their might against
one another, and the King began to be grieved and
angry that all his efforts had availed nothing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_715" id="fnanchor_715"></a><a href="#footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Narrow escape of William.</span>
While
he was thus troubled in mind, a stone was aimed at
him from a lofty turret. It missed William himself,
but a warrior who stood by him was crushed to pieces
by the falling mass.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_716" id="fnanchor_716"></a><a href="#footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></span>
Then there rose a loud shout of
mockery from the wall; “Lo, the King now has fresh
meat; let it be taken to the kitchen and made ready for
his supper.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_717" id="fnanchor_717"></a><a href="#footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></span>
We might have looked to hear that for
such scorn as this the Red King vowed a vengeance like
his father’s vengeance at Alençon. But either Rufus and
his counsellors were strangely cowed, or else they were
glad of any excuse to throw up an enterprise one day of
which seems to have been enough to weary them. <span class="sni">William’s captains advise a retreat.</span>
The
lords and high captains of the King’s host impressed
on their master’s mind that the defences of Mayet were
very strong, that its defenders were very brave, that,
sheltered as they were behind their strong walls, they
had a great advantage over besiegers encamped in the
open air.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_718" id="fnanchor_718"></a><a href="#footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></span>
These sound strange arguments in an age when
warfare chiefly consisted in attacking and defending
strong places. They sound strangest of all when they
<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pageno">294</span>
are addressed to a king who, so short a time before, had
taken it for granted that not only men and walls, but
the winds and the waves, would yield to his will. But
the reasoning of these prudent warriors is said to have
carried conviction to the King’s mind. Rufus saw that
the best thing that he could do was to march off while he
was still safe. There were other ways besides besieging
castles by which more damage could be done to the
enemy with less risk to his own followers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_719" id="fnanchor_719"></a><a href="#footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The siege raised on Tuesday.</span>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">No real success on the King’s part.</span>
This seems a somewhat paltry ending for a campaign
which began with the King’s breathless rush from the
New Forest to Bonneville. Not very much had come
of the headlong ride or of the sail in the crazy ship.
William Rufus had gained no real success, military or
political. He was as far as ever from the real possession
of the whole land of Maine. He had rooted up a great
many vines and cut down a great many fruit trees; but
he had neither won a battle nor taken a fortress. His
garrisons at Le Mans and at Ballon had held out;
Helias had left Le Mans open to him; at Vaux Robert
of Montfort had overcome, not Helias, but the flames.
On the other hand, Helias himself was safe, in full command
of most of his southern castles; from the only one
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">295</span>
of them which the King had actually attacked, he had
turned away baffled after one day’s fighting. <span class="sni">Illustration of Rufus’ character.</span>
In all
these cases it would seem as if the fiery impulses of
Rufus soon spent themselves, as if all depended on the
first rush. If that failed, he never had perseverance to
go on. In his strangely mingled nature, he could be
either a ruler or a captain when the fit to be either took
him. He had not steadiness to be either for any long
time together. <span class="sni">The campaign unfinished.</span>
Certain it is that he left all his continental
campaigns unfinished; and this one, which was
begun with such a special blaze of energy, was left more
utterly unfinished than any of the others. And yet perhaps,
after all, William Rufus had succeeded in the chief
wish of his heart. <span class="sni">William satisfied by the recovery of Le Mans.</span>
Le Mans was the special prize of his
father; its castles were the work of his father. But
his father had had no special dealings with Mayet or
Château-du-Loir. He might be satisfied to do without
such small and distant possessions, he might be satisfied
even to undergo defeat before them, as long as the city
which his father had twice won, as long as the royal
tower which his father had reared, were his beyond
dispute.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">William’s good treatment of Le Mans.</span>
But it is at least to William’s honour that, in his last
entry at Le Mans, he showed himself a benefactor to the
city which had suffered so much. Rufus had, as we
have seen in the case of Robert of Bellême, men about
him who were worse than himself. Or rather, putting
aside such exceptional sinners as Robert of Bellême, he
had men about him who simply did, as a matter of
course, according to the fashion of the time, without
either rising or sinking to those parts of the character
of Rufus which are special to himself. So now the
citizens of Le Mans found in the Red King himself
a deliverer from the oppressions done by his officers.
<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pageno">296</span>
Those among the inhabitants who had stayed in the
city and had not followed their Count in his flight, had
suffered every kind of wrong-doing at the hands of the
King’s garrisons. <span class="sni">He enters the city.</span>
The tale, according to the local historian,
was too long and sad to tell in full.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_721" id="fnanchor_721"></a><a href="#footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></span>
But matters
grew better when the King came himself. William again
entered Le Mans in triumph, a triumph won chiefly over
vines and apple-trees, certainly not over the garrison of
Mayet.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_722" id="fnanchor_722"></a><a href="#footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></span>
<span class="sni">He stops the oppressions of his garrison.</span>

leaving garrisons in the castles of

left the mainland for the last time, and, after an absence

But, if William Rufus, on his last visit to Le Mans,
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pageno">297</span>
saved the inhabitants of the city from ruin, he presently
deprived the city itself of one of its chief material ornaments.
It was the election of Hildebert which had first
stirred up his wrath, and he had picked out the lands of
the bishopric, as the lands of a personal enemy, for special
havoc.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_727" id="fnanchor_727"></a><a href="#footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></span>

<span class="sni">Charges brought against him.</span>
But, after William had again entered Le Mans, the charge
was once more brought against the Bishop by some of
the clergy of Saint Julian’s who had opposed his election
from the beginning. It was by Hildebert’s counsel, they
said, that Helias had been received, and that the King’s
castles had been besieged; nay, the towers of the minster
itself, the twin towers of Howel, had been used, as they
well might be, for the attack on the royal tower. <span class="sni">William bids Hildebert pull down the towers of Saint Julian’s.</span>
William
hearkened to the enemies of Hildebert, and gave him his
choice, either to pull down the towers which were so liable
to abuse, or else to follow him at once into England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_729" id="fnanchor_729"></a><a href="#footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></span>
To
the Bishop of Le Mans the sea-voyage itself seemed frightful;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_730" id="fnanchor_730"></a><a href="#footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></span>
and when its dangers were passed, when Hildebert
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">298</span>
had reached the shores of our island, his enemies, who
seem to have crossed also, again began to accuse him
to the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_731" id="fnanchor_731"></a><a href="#footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Dialogue between William and Hildebert.</span>
A strange dialogue followed between
the two. William, in his craft, offered to purchase the
destruction of the towers at a price which would have
greatly increased the internal splendour of the church.
Let the Bishop agree to pull down the towers, and he,
King William, will give him a vast mass of gold and
silver for the adornment of the new shrine of Saint
Julian.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_732" id="fnanchor_732"></a><a href="#footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></span>
But the Bishop had his craft also. He was in
the land so famous for gold and silver work, the land
where Otto and Theodoric were doubtless still plying
their craft. They had no such goldsmiths at Le Mans;
let the King keep his precious ingots for works within
his own kingdom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_733" id="fnanchor_733"></a><a href="#footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></span>
Still the destruction of the towers
is pressed upon him; all that he can gain, and that with
difficulty, is a little delay. Hildebert at last went back
to Le Mans, taking with him, not indeed the King’s great
ingots, but some lesser ornaments for his church.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_734" id="fnanchor_734"></a><a href="#footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></span>
The
burning of the city, the dispersion of his canons, the havoc
wrought in his own lands, all weighed him down. He
poured forth the full bitterness of his soul in his extant
<a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pageno">299</span>
letters. The unrepealed order for the pulling down of
the two towers still hung over him. Was it ever carried
out? Our author does not say distinctly. We might
rather infer from his story that the death of Rufus and the
return of Helias saved the Bishop from his difficulties.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_735" id="fnanchor_735"></a><a href="#footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></span>
Yet the appearance of the building itself looks the other
way. <span class="sni">The southern tower.</span>
As the church of Saint Julian now stands, the
southern tower of Howel has its existing representative.
It is slender, and, if it stood against a building of
ordinary height, it would be tall. Its upper part belongs
to the late rebuilding of the transepts, but the
lowest stage belongs to the latest and richest style of
Romanesque, contemporary with the great recasting of
the nave. It is no work of Howel or even of Hildebert;
but it is the work of one who wished to reproduce, with
the richer detail of his own day, the general likeness of
what Howel’s tower had been. <span class="sni">Appearance on the north side.</span>
On the north side this
tower has no fellow; the space at the end of the transept
which answers to it is occupied by a ruined building of
earlier Romanesque, which may well be the stump of
the original tower of Howel.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_736" id="fnanchor_736"></a><a href="#footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></span>
Are we to infer that the
bidding of Rufus was carried out&mdash;&#8203;that the towers, or
their upper stages, were actually destroyed&mdash;&#8203;that every
later ruler of Le Mans, the devout Helias among them,
deemed the northern tower too near to the royal fortress
to allow of its rebuilding, but that the rebuilding of the
more distant tower on the southern side was begun in
the earlier and finished in the later recasting of the
church? May we look on the shattered building which
joins hard to the northern transept of Saint Julian’s as
being truly the remnant of a tower which Howel reared
with the good will of William the Great, and which
Hildebert, with a heavy heart, pulled down at the bidding
of William the Red? If it be so, I know of no
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pageno">300</span>
spot where architectural evidence speaks more strongly
to the mind, where walls and columns and arches
bring us more directly into the presence of the men
who made and who unmade them. Among all the wonders
of Saint Julian’s minster&mdash;&#8203;beside the nave which is
inseparably bound up with so many living pages of our
story&mdash;&#8203;beside the choir which in itself concerns not the
historian of Norman kings and Cenomannian counts,
but on which we gaze in breathless wonder as one of the
noblest of the works of man&mdash;&#8203;no spot comes more truly
home to us than that where we see the small remnants
of what once was there and is there no longer. Alongside
of the soaring apse to the east, of the wide portal
to the west, the northern tower of Howel is indeed
conspicuous by its absence.</p>

<p class="p2">The second war with Maine is the only event beyond
the bounds of England which our own annalists record
under this year, except indeed those œcumenical events
besides which the affairs of Maine, and even the affairs
of England, seem for the moment but as trifles. <span class="sni">Robert at Jerusalem. July, 1099.</span>
In the
same month of July in which William made his way
into Le Mans, his brother Robert, in quite another warfare,
made his way into Jerusalem.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_737" id="fnanchor_737"></a><a href="#footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></span>
Presently, before
he could have heard of his own work, the great preacher
of the crusade, <span class="sni">Death of Pope Urban. July 29.</span>
Pope Urban the Second, passed away.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_738" id="fnanchor_738"></a><a href="#footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></span>
With the affairs of Maine these events have a direct
connexion. It was not the fault of Count Helias
that he did not obey the teaching of Urban, that he
did not enter the Holy City alongside of Robert and
Godfrey. <span class="sni">Revolt in Anglesey. 1099.</span>
But it needs an effort to turn away either
from Jerusalem or from Le Mans to record the last
counter-revolution in Anglesey. Yet it is not amiss to
remember that two lands were at the same moment
striving for freedom against the Red King, and that the
<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pageno">301</span>
Briton and the Cenomannian had to hold their own
against the same enemy. He who ruled at once at Bellême
and at Shrewsbury was terrible to both alike. We
may believe that the Britons marked their time while
the fierce Earl had his hands full beyond the Channel,
to strike another blow to win back their land, and
specially to win back the island which had been the
scene of the warfare of the last year. <span class="sni">Return of Cadwgan and Gruffydd.</span> But it would
seem that, in some parts at least of the land, there
was little need for blows.
The two princes who had
fled to Ireland, Cadwgan son of Bleddyn and Gruffydd
son of Cynan, now came back. Cadwgan obtained a
peaceful settlement in Ceredigion; <span class="sni">Recovery of Anglesey and Ceredigion by the Welsh.</span>
Gruffydd got possession
of Anglesey, perhaps as the price of warfare.
A son of Cadwgan, Llywelyn, was presently killed by
the men of Brecheiniog, that is doubtless by the followers
of Bernard of Newmarch.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_739" id="fnanchor_739"></a><a href="#footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></span>
Another Welsh
prince, Howel by name, had to flee to Ireland.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_740" id="fnanchor_740"></a><a href="#footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></span>
We
may infer that the central border-land was still firmly
held by the conquerors, but that, though the French had
constrained the Britons of Anglesey to become Saxons,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_741" id="fnanchor_741"></a><a href="#footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></span>
French and Saxons alike had to yield to the returning
Britons both in Anglesey and in Ceredigion. Gruffydd
and Cadwgan, names which are by this time familiar
to us, are again established in Britain. Both of them
play a part in the later history of their own land, and
Cadwgan at least will appear again within the range of
our own story.</p>

<p class="p2">These Welsh matters find no place in the English
<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pageno">302</span>
Chronicles, which find so little space even for the deeds
of Helias. Most likely they made no great impression
on the mind of Rufus, now that, not Maine indeed, but
at least Le Mans, was again his. He came back to
England, a conqueror doubtless in his own eyes, about
the feast of Saint Michael. <span class="sni">Natural phænomenon.</span>
The year did not end
without one of those natural phenomena in which the
reign is so rich. <span class="sni">The great tide. November 3, 1099.</span>
This time it was the wonderful flood-tide
which, in the beginning of November, on a day of
new moon, came up the Thames, flooded the land, overwhelmed
houses and villages, and swept away men, oxen,
and sheep.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_742" id="fnanchor_742"></a><a href="#footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></span>
A month later a new source of revenue
began to flow into the Red King’s coffers. <span class="sni">Death of Bishop Osmund of Salisbury. December 3, 1099.</span>
Bishop
Osmund of Salisbury, the founder alike of the elder

His temporalities passed, like
those of Canterbury and Winchester, into the King’s
hands. The Bishop of Durham had doubtless bade farewell
to such duties; but the race of <em>exactores</em>, of clerical
<em>exactores</em>, had not died out. There were still plenty of
men in the Red King’s court who were ready to help
in wringing the last penny out of the lands of bishops
till they had wrung enough to buy bishoprics for themselves.
The end is now drawing nigh; but till the end
came, the groans of the Church, of the tenants of the
Church, and of the whole people of the land, went up
with a voice ever louder and louder.</p>

<p class="p2 dropcap negindent">The last year of the eleventh century had now come. <span class="sni">End of the eleventh century.</span>
The course of those hundred years had wrought
many changes in the world. To our eyes the changes
which it had wrought in the isle of Britain seem great
and wonderful, and great and wonderful they were. <span class="sni">Changes in Britain. 1000&ndash;1100.</span> At
the beginning of the century Englishmen were struggling
for their country and their homes against the invading
Dane. The Dane had won the land; he had given us
one foreign ruler who became one of ourselves. The
days of foreign rule had passed away, only, as the event
proved, to pave the way for a foreign rule which was to
be far more abiding. A foreign rule which, by adopting
national feelings, in some sort deadened them paved the
way for a foreign rule which, by seeming for a moment
to crush the old life of the nation, really called it up
again in new shapes. But the rule of the Norman could
<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pageno">304</span>
not, like the rule of Cnut, itself become national during
the life-time of the Conqueror or of his first successor.
<span class="sni">Internal changes.</span>
There was indeed a change between the England of
Æthelred and the England of William Rufus. The outward
aspect of the land itself must have changed, now
that well-nigh every English mound was crowned by its
Norman castle, now that well-nigh every English minster
was giving way to a successor built after Norman patterns.
But, if things had changed, men had changed
also. Compare the signatures to a charter of Æthelred
and the signatures to a charter of William. The
change which had come over the land is marked by the
difference between the list of English names among
which it may be that some follower of the Norman
Lady has crept in, and the list of Norman names
among which it may be that some unusually lucky
Englishman has contrived to hold his place. <span class="sni">Changes in foreign relations.</span>
England
had thus changed indeed in her internal state; she
had changed no less in her relations to other lands.
Within her own island she had made what it is no
contradiction to speak of as a peaceful conquest made
at the sword’s point. <span class="sni">Scotland.</span>
The elder Eadgar had placed the
younger on the Scottish throne as the work of warfare.
So far as Eadgar’s work was the political submission of
Scotland, its results were but for a moment. So far as
it led to the peaceful change of Scotland into a second
and separate English kingdom, its results have been
indeed abiding. <span class="sni">Wales.</span>
Towards Wales, amidst much of seeming
ill-success, the work of conquest had in truth begun;
the Red King had found out the true way to curb those
bold spirits which he could not overcome in the field.
<span class="sni">Fusion of elements in Britain begins.</span>
Much indeed had the eleventh century done, in different
ways, towards welding the three elements of the isle
of Britain into one political whole. Ages had to pass
before the work was finished; but it was in the eleventh
<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pageno">305</span>
century, above all, in the reign of Rufus, that it really
began. <span class="sni">Ireland.</span>
Towards the impossible work, forbidden by
geography and history, of welding another great island
into the same whole, whatever either William may have
dreamed&mdash;&#8203;yet to the Conqueror we may not dare to
ascribe mere dreams&mdash;&#8203;neither had done anything. So
far as the two great islands of the Ocean had begun to
draw near to one another, it was as yet wholly through
the advances which the princes and people of Ireland
had made in spiritual things to the Pontiff of the other
world, the Patriarch of all the nations beyond the sea.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Britain ceases to be another world.</span>
But one great work of the times over which we are
casting our eyes was that Britain was now fast ceasing
to deserve its ancient name of another world.
The earliest and the latest years of the century are each
marked by a marriage, by a change of name on the part
of the bride, which puts the change before us in a living
way. <span class="sni">Marriages of Ælfgifu-Emma and Eadgyth-Matilda.</span> A new epoch of intercourse with other lands had
begun when, on her marriage with a King of the
English of her day, Norman Emma had to become
English Ælfgifu. How greatly things had turned the
other way was shown when, on her marriage with a
King of the English of her day, English Eadgyth had
to become Norman Matilda. <span class="sni">England becomes part of the Latin world.</span>
The land which was to
be the realm of Henry and Matilda was, through the
chain of events which began with Emma’s marriage, fast
changing from the separate world of Æthelred’s day into
a part of the larger world of Western Europe, the world of
<em>Latinitas</em>, of Latin speech and of learning, the world
which, amidst all the struggles of rival Popes and Emperors,
still deemed itself the world of Rome. <span class="sni">Advance of the Latin world in the eleventh century.</span>
And in
few ages had that world done more to extend itself
than in the age which began with Æthelred and ended
with Henry. At the beginning of the century northern
Europe was still largely heathen; England was fighting
<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><span class="pageno">306</span>
the battle of Christendom against the Danish
renegade. <span class="sni">Conversion of the North. The Crusade.</span>
Now the kingdoms of the North had passed
into the Christian fold. The change between the beginning
of the century and the end is best marked
by saying that before its end the crusades had begun,
that the first crusade had been crowned with the greatest
of crusading victories. But, in looking at the crusades
of the East, the abiding crusade of the West must not
be forgotten. <span class="sni">The struggle in Spain.</span>
Our own Chronicler has not failed to tell
us somewhat of the great strife of Christian and Saracen
in the south-western peninsula,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_745" id="fnanchor_745"></a><a href="#footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></span>
and if the taking of
Toledo was followed by reverses of the Christian arms,
it was only by dint of help from Africa. Here is a sign
that the tide was turned, and that it was only by such
help from beyond the straits, by a new passage of Africa
into Europe, that Islam could maintain itself in the once
Roman and Gothic land. In the Eastern world, the
crusade should not make us forget the causes of the
crusade. <span class="sni">Decline of the Eastern Empire.</span>
At the beginning of the century we saw the
Eastern Rome in her full might, the might of Saracenic
victories which were already won, of Bulgarian victories
which were winning. But now, as the Western Mussulman
has to call in help from Africa, so the Eastern
Christian has to call in help from Western Europe.
<span class="sni">Renewed advance.</span>
The Christian frontier in Asia has indeed frightfully
gone back since the beginning of the century; but it
has again begun to advance; Nikaia, Antioch, Jerusalem
itself, are restored to the Christian world, and
Nikaia is restored, not only to the Christian world but
to the obedience of the Eastern Augustus. <span class="sni">Sicily.</span>
And, by not
least memorable change among so many, the great Mediterranean
island, the battle-field of Greek and Saracen,
has passed away from the rule of either, while remaining
the flourishing dwelling-place of both. Sicily has entered
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pageno">307</span>
within the range of Western Christendom, and Palermo,
like Winchester, has entered within the range of Norman
dominion. When Æthelred reigned at Winchester and
Richard at Rouen, a bishop of Evreux could not have
performed the funeral rites of a bishop of Bayeux within
the walls and between the havens of the Happy City.</p>

<p>Changes then had been great in east and west and
north and south during the century which carries us
from Otto the Wonder of the World and Basil the Slayer
of the Bulgarians to what at first sight seems the lower
level of Henry the Fourth and Alexios Komnênos. <span class="sni">Change from Æthelred to William Rufus.</span>
And
when in our own land the same space carries us from
Æthelred to William Rufus, the gap seems wider still.
And it was at least not the fault of William Rufus that
the changes wrought by the eleventh century were not
greater still. Æthelred, the man without rede, was not
likely to change the face of the world, unless by passively
supplying the means for Swegen and Cnut to
change it. But William Rufus had no lack of rede of
one kind, though it was perhaps of a kind which better
deserved to be called <em>unrede</em>. But it was <em>unrede</em> of a
more active kind than the <em>unrede</em> of Æthelred. <span class="sni">Schemes of Rufus.</span>
William
was eager enough to change the face of the world for
his own behoof. To win, after a sort, the submission of
Scotland and Maine, to plan the conquest of Ireland and
France, to negotiate for the purchase of Aquitaine&mdash;&#8203;here
alone are far-reaching plans enough, plans which could
not have been carried out without some large result on
the history of mankind. That result could never have
been the lasting establishment of that Empire of Gaul and
Britain of which Rufus seems to have dreamed. But had
his continental plans been successful, they might have led,
as the marriage of Lewis and Eleanor in the next century
might have led, to the formation of a kingdom of France
in the modern sense some ages before its time.</p>

<p><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pageno">308</span>
<span class="sni">Contradiction in William’s position.</span>
The strange thing is that a man who schemed so much,
who filled so great a place in the eyes of his own generation,
after all did so little. Almost more strange is the
way in which he sees all his great plans utterly shattered,
and yet seems to feel no shame, no discouragement, no
shock to his belief in his own greatness. He comes back
really defeated; he has twice won Le Mans, and that is all;
but if he has won Le Mans, he cannot win Mayet. So
far from winning Paris, he cannot win Chaumont. So far
from reigning on the Garonne, he cannot keep even the
frontier of the Loir. <span class="sni">His defeats not counted defeats.</span>
But what would have been counted
defeat in any one else does not seem to have been counted
defeat in William Rufus. Beaten at all points but one,
he still keeps the air of a conqueror; he still seems
to be looked on as a conqueror by others. From the
beginning to the end, there is a kind of glamour about
the Red King and all that he does. He has a kind of
sleight of hand which imposes on men’s minds; like the
Athenian orator, when he is thrown in the wrestling-match,
he makes those who saw his fall believe that he
has never fallen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_746" id="fnanchor_746"></a><a href="#footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></span>
We might even borrow a word from
the piebald jargon of modern diplomacy; we might say
that the reign of the Red King was the highest recorded
effort of <em>prestige</em>.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">The year 1100.</span>
And now we have entered on the last year of the reign
and of the century. <span class="sni">Lack of events in its earlier months.</span>
It is a year whose earlier months
are, within our own range at least, singularly barren of
events, while its latter months are full of matter to record.
It is a kind of tribute to the importance of William
Rufus that there is at once so much to record the
moment he is out of the way. When he is gone, a large
part of the world feels relief. But about the lack of events
earlier in the year there is something strange and solemn.
<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pageno">309</span>
<span class="sni">Contrast with the year 1000.</span>
The last year of the eleventh century was not marked
by that general feeling of awe and wonder and looking
forward to judgement which marked the last year of the
tenth century. <span class="sni">Vague expectations afloat.</span>
But, at least within the range of the
Red King’s influence, that year seems to have been
marked by that vague kind of feeling of a coming something
which some of us have felt before the great events
of our own times. Whatever may be the cause, it is
certain that, as the news of events which have happened
sometimes travels with a speed which ordinary means
cannot account for,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_747" id="fnanchor_747"></a><a href="#footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></span>
so the approach of events which
have not yet happened is sometimes felt in a way which
we can account for as little. Coming events do cast
their shadows before them, in a fashion which, whether
philosophy can explain it or not, history must accept as
a fact. And coming events did preeminently cast their
shadows before them in the first half of the year 1100.
<span class="sni">Portents and prophecies.</span>
In that age the feeling which weighed on men’s minds
naturally took the form of portent and prophecy, of
strange sights seen and strange sounds listened to.
There is not the slightest ground for thinking that all
these tales are mere inventions after the fact, though
they were likely enough to be improved in the telling
after the fact. The frightful state of things in the
land, unparalleled even in those evil times, joined with
the feeling of expectation which always attends any
marked note of time, be it a fresh week or a fresh
millennium&mdash;&#8203;all worked together to bring about a looking
for something to come, partly perhaps in fear, but
far more largely in hope. Things could hardly get worse;
they might get better. Men’s minds were charged with
expectation; every sight, every sound, became an omen;
if some men risked prophecies, if some of their prophecies
were fulfilled, it was not wonderful. The first half of
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pageno">310</span>
the year, blank in events, was rich in auguries; in the
second half the auguries had largely become facts. In
its first months men were saying with hope, “Non diu
dominabuntur effeminati.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_748" id="fnanchor_748"></a><a href="#footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></span>
Before the twelvemonth was
out, they were beginning to say with joy, “Hic rex
Henricus destruxit impios regni.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_749" id="fnanchor_749"></a><a href="#footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></span></p>

places.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_750" id="fnanchor_750"></a><a href="#footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></span>
At Christmas William Rufus wore his crown
at Gloucester, the place of his momentary repentance
and of his wildest insolence. He had there given the
staff to Anselm; he had there sent away Malcolm
from his court without a hearing. <span class="sni">Easter at Winchester. April 1, 1100.</span>
At Easter he wore
his crown at Winchester, the city which had first received
him after the death of his father, where he had
first unlocked his father’s treasures, and had put in
bonds those whom his father had set free. <span class="sni">Pentecost at Westminster. May 20, 1100.</span>
At Whitsuntide
he wore his crown at Westminster, and again
held the assembly and the banquet in the mighty hall of
his own rearing. <span class="sni">No record of these assemblies.</span>
We have no record of the acts of any
of these three assemblies. The two former at least may
well have been gatherings which came together more
for the display of kingly magnificence than for the
transaction of any real business of the realm. All
things seemed to be as glorious as ever for the defeated
of Mayet and Chaumont. In the death of Urban
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pageno">311</span>
Rufus saw the removal of an enemy, at least of a
hindrance in his way. <span class="sni">Death of Urban.</span>
He had indeed found that Urban
could be won to his will by a bribe. Still he was a
Pope, a Pope whom he had himself acknowledged, a
Pope whom it might be needful to bribe. Better far was
it to come back to the happy days before he had been
cajoled by Cardinal Walter, before he had been frightened
into naming Anselm, the happy days when he was
troubled by no archbishop in the land and no pope out
of it. Those days were come again. Anselm was far
away; Urban was dead; Paschal he had not acknowledged.
The last recorded words of Rufus before the
day of Lammas and its morrow were those in which
he set forth his fixed purpose to use as he would the
freedom which was his once more.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_751" id="fnanchor_751"></a><a href="#footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></span></p>

<p>But if we have no record of the three assemblies of
the year, if we have no traditional sayings of the King,
if we have no record of anything that really happened
during these months, we can see that great schemes
were planned; great preparations were making, which
must have been the matter of deep debates at the Pentecostal
assembly. Our own Chroniclers are silent; our
tidings come from our familiar teacher at Saint Evroul.
<span class="sni">Continental schemes of Rufus.</span>
Though the Red King kept himself so close in his island
kingdom, he was planning greater things than ever beyond
the sea. He had Normandy to keep and he had
Aquitaine to win. For such objects he had need of both
gold and steel, and we cannot doubt that in the assembly
held at Whitsuntide within the new hall of Westminster
King William demanded no small store of both to enable
him to carry out the schemes of his overweening pride.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Robert’s return from the crusade.</span>
Normandy was to be kept. Duke Robert, the bold
crusader, was coming back from the lands where his
name, once so despised in his own duchy, had been
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">312</span>
crowned with unlooked-for glory. He was coming back
by the path by which he had gone, through the Norman
lands of southern Italy. <span class="sni">His marriage with Sibyl of Conversana.</span> And he was coming with a
companion whose presence promised something in the
way of amendment alike of his private life and of his
public government. He brought with him a wife, Sibyl
of Conversana, daughter of Geoffrey lord of Brindisi,
and grand-niece of Robert Wiscard. <span class="sni">His reception in south Italy.</span>
He had been welcomed
by his southern countrymen with all honours
and with precious gifts; <a name="line312_10" id="line312_10"></a>both Rogers, the Duke of
Apulia and the young Count of Sicily, to be one day
the first and all but the most famous of Sicilian kings,
were zealous in showing their regard. <span class="sni">Character of the Duchess Sibyl.</span>
But from the house
of the Count of Conversana he took away the most precious
gift of all in a woman who is described as uniting
all merits and beauties within and without, and who was
certainly far better fitted to rule the duchy of Normandy
than he was.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_752" id="fnanchor_752"></a><a href="#footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His funds for buying back the duchy.</span>

<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pageno">313</span>
But William Rufus had no thought of restoring the
pledge; he had Normandy in his grasp, and he had no
mind to let it go.</p>

<p><span class="sni">William of Aquitaine; his crusade;</span>
But besides this, Aquitaine was to be won. It was
indeed to be won in a peaceful sort, as far as the engagements
of its sovereign went. Duke William of
Poitiers, the ally of William of England in his French
campaign, was at last ready for his crusade. Strange
warrior of the cross, strange comrade for Godfrey or even
for Robert, was he who, after his return from the Sepulchre,
spared the life of a holy bishop who rebuked him
on the ground that he hated him too much to send him
to paradise, who brought together the monastic harem at
Niort, and who marched to battle with the form of his
adulterous mistress painted on his shield.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_754" id="fnanchor_754"></a><a href="#footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></span>
But now he
was setting forth for the holy war. Thirty thousand
warriors&mdash;&#8203;the conventional number everywhere&mdash;&#8203;from
Aquitaine, Gascony, and other lands of southern Gaul,
were ready, we are told, to follow in his train.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_755" id="fnanchor_755"></a><a href="#footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></span>
<span class="sni">He proposes to pledge his duchy to Rufus.</span>
But
Duke William, like Duke Robert, lacked money. He
sent therefore to the master of the hoard which seemed
open to all comers, seeking to pledge his duchy, as
Robert had pledged his.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_756" id="fnanchor_756"></a><a href="#footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></span>
We cannot help suspecting
that some such arrangement had been made at an earlier
time, when the two Williams joined their forces together
against France; but, if not made then, it was made now.
King William readily agreed to an offer which would
practically make him master of the greater part of Gaul.
<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">314</span>
He was lord of Normandy; he held himself to be master of
Maine; he was about to become lord of Aquitaine. <span class="sni">Preparations for occupation of Aquitaine.</span>
Maine
and Poitou indeed did not march on each other; but Anjou
might be won by some means. Fulk could not hold out
against a prince who hemmed him in on either side.
Either gold or steel would surely open the way to Angers,
as well as to Rouen and to Bourdeaux. Prepared for all
chances, William was gathering money, gathering ships,
gathering men, for a greater work than fruitless attacks
on Mayet and Chaumont, for the great task of enlarging
his dominion,--our guide says to the Garonne; he should
rather have said to the Pyrenees. Robert was to be kept
out of Normandy; to restore to the debtor his pledge was
the dull virtue of the merchant or the Jew; such duties
touched not the honour of the good knight. No man
could perform all his promises, and the restoration of
Normandy was a promise of the class which needed not
to be performed. Aquitaine was to be peacefully bought;
but possibly arms might be needed there also. All who
should dare to withstand the extension of William’s dominion
to the most southern borders of Gaul were to be
brought to obedience at the sword’s point.</p>

<p><span class="sni">His alleged designs on the Empire.</span>
I have said “dominion;” but the word in the writer
whom I follow is <em>Empire</em>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_757" id="fnanchor_757"></a><a href="#footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></span>
That name, one not unknown
to us in the history of Rufus, may have been
dropped at random; but it may have been meant to
show that mightier schemes still were at work in the
restless brain of the Red King. We may couple the
phrase with vague hints dropped elsewhere, which show
<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pageno">315</span>
that, whether Rufus really thought of it or not, men gave
him credit for dreams of dominion greater even than the
supplanting of Fulk of Angers, of William of Poitiers,
and of Philip of Paris all at once. The doctrine that
Britain was a land fruitful in tyrants was to be carried
out on a greater scale than it had been in the days of
Carausius or Maximus or the later Constantine. The
father had once been looked for at kingly Aachen;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_758" id="fnanchor_758"></a><a href="#footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></span>
the
son, so men believed, hoped to march in the steps of
Brennus to imperial Rome.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_759" id="fnanchor_759"></a><a href="#footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></span>
He would outdo the glory
of all crusaders, of princes of Antioch and kings of
Jerusalem. Geoffrey, Bohemund, his own brother, had
knelt as vassals in the New Rome; he would sit as an
Emperor in the Old. Then he would have no question
about acknowledging or not acknowledging popes;
he would make them or refuse to make them as he
thought good. The patrimony of Saint Peter might
be let to farm, along with the estates of Canterbury
and Winchester and Salisbury. Whether such thoughts
really passed through the mind of William Rufus we can
neither affirm nor deny. That men could believe that
they were passing through his mind shows that they
believed, and rightly, that he was capable of dreaming,
of planning, of attempting, anything.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Portents.</span>
But while the preparations were making, the portents
were gathering. First came a stroke which reads like a
rehearsal of his own end. While Robert was coming
back with his Sibyl to found a new and legitimate
dynasty in the Norman duchy, a blow fell on one of the
children of his earlier wanderings.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_760" id="fnanchor_760"></a><a href="#footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Death of young Richard. May, 1100.</span>
One Richard had
already fallen in the haunted shades of the New Forest,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_761" id="fnanchor_761"></a><a href="#footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a></span>
and his death opened the path for his younger
brother to reign at Winchester and Rouen and Le Mans,
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">316</span>
and to dream of reigning at Dublin, Paris, Poitiers, and
Rome. Another Richard, the natural son of Duke
Robert, who must have been enrolled in the service of
his uncle, was cut off on the same fatal ground early in
May, shortly before the Westminster assembly. The
King’s knights were hunting the deer in the forest; one
of them drew his bow to bring down a stag; the arrow
missed the intended victim, and pierced Richard with a
stroke which brought him dead to the ground.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_762" id="fnanchor_762"></a><a href="#footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></span>
Great
grief followed his fall; his unwitting slayer, to escape
from vengeance, fled and became a monk.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_763" id="fnanchor_763"></a><a href="#footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></span>
Young
Richard thus died while his uncle was making ready to
keep his father out of the dominions which he was
pledged to restore. <span class="sni">William, natural son of Robert.</span>
His brother William, the other son
of Robert’s vagrant days, seems to have followed the
fortunes of his father, till, after Tinchebrai, he went to
Jerusalem and died fighting in the Holy War.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_764" id="fnanchor_764"></a><a href="#footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The death of Richard might be a warning. It might
be taken as a sign that some special power of destiny
hovered over the spot where the dwellings of man and
the houses of God had been swept away to make clearer
ground for sports where joy is sought for in the wanton
infliction of death and suffering. Still it was no portent
out of the ordinary course of nature. But portents of
this kind too were not lacking. <span class="sni">Wonders and apparitions.</span>

As the day approaches, a
crowd of vivid pictures seems to pass before us. <span class="sni">Warlike preparations. June-July, 1100.</span>
June
and July passed amidst preparations for war, but July
saw also one great ecclesiastical ceremony. Abbot
Serlo’s minster of Gloucester was now near enough to
perfection for its consecration to be sought for. Whether
all the lofty pillars of the nave were as yet reared or not,
at least that massive eastern limb with its surrounding
chapels, which may still be seen through the lace-work
of later times, was already finished. <span class="sni">Consecration of Gloucester Abbey. July 15, 1100.</span>
The rite of its
hallowing was done by the diocesan Samson and three
other bishops, Gundulf of Rochester, Gerard of Hereford,
and Hervey the shepherd of the stormy diocese of
Bangor. The zeal of the monks and their visitors was
stirred up by the ceremony, and the house of Saint
Peter at Gloucester became a special seat of vision and
prophecy. <span class="sni">Vision and prophecies.</span>
One godly brother<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_768" id="fnanchor_768"></a><a href="#footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></span>
saw in the dreams of
the night the Lord sitting on his throne, with the
hosts of heaven and the choirs of the saints around
<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">318</span>
him. A fair and stately virgin stood forth and knelt
before the Lord. She prayed him to have pity on his
people who were ground down beneath the yoke of King
William of England. The dreamer trembled, and understood
that the suppliant was the holy Church of
Christ, calling on her Lord and Saviour to look down on
all that her children bore from the lusts and robberies
and other evil deeds of the King and his followers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_769" id="fnanchor_769"></a><a href="#footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></span>
Serlo, filled with holy zeal, set down the vision in
writing, and sent the message of warning to the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_770" id="fnanchor_770"></a><a href="#footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Abbot Fulchered’s sermon at Gloucester. August 1, 1100.</span>
But the visions of the night were not all. A more
open voice of prophecy, so men deemed, was not lacking.
A few days after the monk’s vision, on the day of
Lammas, a crowd of all classes was gathered in Saint
Peter’s church at Gloucester to keep the feast of Saint
Peter-in-Chains.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_771" id="fnanchor_771"></a><a href="#footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a></span>
Fulchered, Abbot of Earl Roger’s
house at Shrewsbury, once a monk of Earl Roger’s house
at Seez, an eloquent preacher of the divine word, was
chosen from a crowd of elders<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_772" id="fnanchor_772"></a><a href="#footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></span>
to make his discourse to
the people. A near neighbour of the terrible son of his
own founder, none could know better than he under
what woes the land was groaning. Fulchered mounted
the pulpit of the newly-hallowed minster, and the spirit
of the old prophets came upon him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_773" id="fnanchor_773"></a><a href="#footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></span>
In glowing words
<a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span class="pageno">319</span>
he set forth the sins and sorrows of the time, how England
was given as an heritage to be trodden under foot of
the ungodly. Lust, greediness, pride, all were rampant,
pride which would, if it were possible, trample under
foot the very stars of heaven.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_774" id="fnanchor_774"></a><a href="#footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></span>
The words have the
ring of the words of Eadward on his deathbed; but
Eadward had to tell of coming sorrow, and of only distant
deliverance. Fulchered could tell of a deliverance which
was nigh, even at the doors. A sudden change was at
hand; the men who had ceased to be men should rule no
longer.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_775" id="fnanchor_775"></a><a href="#footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a></span>
And then in a strain which seems to carry us on
to the days of Naseby and Dunbar, he told how the Lord
God was coming to judge the open enemies of his spouse.
He told how the Almighty would smite Moab and Edom
with the sword of vengeance, and overthrow the mountains
of Gilboa with a fearful shaking. “Lo,” he went
on, “the bow of wrath from on high is bent against the
wicked, and the arrow swift to wound is drawn from
the quiver. It shall soon smite, and that suddenly; let
every man that is wise amend his ways and avoid its
stroke.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_776" id="fnanchor_776"></a><a href="#footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is the report of Abbot Fulchered’s sermon, as it
is told us by one who no doubt set down with a special
interest the words of the first prelate of the minster into
which the humble church of his own father had grown.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_777" id="fnanchor_777"></a><a href="#footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The alleged dream of the King.</span>
Other stories tell us how on the night of that same
Wednesday a more fearful dream than that of the monk
<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pageno">320</span>
of Gloucester disturbed the slumbers of some one. In
the earlier version the seer is a monk from beyond sea;
in its later form the terrible warning is vouchsafed to
the King himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_778" id="fnanchor_778"></a><a href="#footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></span>
The story, as usual, puts on fresh
details as it grows; but its essential features are the
same in its simplest and in its most elaborate shape.
The King, with his proud and swelling air, scorning all
around him, enters a church. In one version it is a
chapel in a forest; in another it is a minster gorgeously
adorned. Its walls were robed with velvet and purple,
stuffs wrought by the skill of the Greek, and with tapestry
where the deeds of past times lived in stitch-work,
like the tale of Brihtnoth at Ely and the newer tale of
William at Bayeux.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_779" id="fnanchor_779"></a><a href="#footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></span>
Here were goodly books, here were
the shrines of saints, gleaming with gold and gems and
ivory, a sight such as the eyes of the master and spoiler
of so many churches had never rested on. At a second
glance all this bravery passed away; the walls and the
altar itself stood bare. At a third glance he saw the
form of a man lying bare upon the altar. A cannibal
desire came on him; he ate, or strove to eat, of the
body that lay before him. His victim endured for a
while in patience; then his face, hitherto goodly and
gentle as of an angel, became stern beyond words, and
he spoke&mdash;“Is it not enough that thou hast thus far
grieved me with so many wrongs? Wilt thou gnaw my
very flesh and bones?” One version gives the words
another turn; the stern voice answers simply, “Henceforth
thou shalt eat of me no more.” <span class="sni">Exhortation of Gundulf.</span>
In those accounts
which make the King the dreamer, Rufus tells the vision
to a bishop&mdash;&#8203;one tale names Gundulf&mdash;&#8203;who explains
the easy parable. The exhortation follows, to mend his
<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pageno">321</span>
ways, to hold a synod and to restore Anselm. The
King, in one account, in a momentary fit of penitence,
promises to do so. But his better feelings pass away; in
defiance of all warnings, he goes forth to hunt on the
fatal ground, the scene of the wrong and sacrilege of his
father&mdash;&#8203;in some of these versions the scene of further
wrong and sacrilege of his own.</p>

<p class="p2">The details of some of these stories I shall discuss
elsewhere. If they prove nothing else, they prove at
least the deep impression which the Red King’s life and
the Red King’s end made on the men of his own days
and of the days which followed them. <span class="sni">William at Brockenhurst. August 1, 1100.</span>
One thing is
certain; on the first day of August, while Fulchered was
preaching at Gloucester, King William was in the New
Forest, with his head-quarters seemingly at Brockenhurst.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_780" id="fnanchor_780"></a><a href="#footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His companions.</span>
He had with him several men whose names are
known to us, as Gilbert of Laigle, once so fierce against
William’s cause at Rouen, Gilbert and Roger of Clare,
the former of whom had won his forgiveness by his
timely revelations on the march to Bamburgh.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_781" id="fnanchor_781"></a><a href="#footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Henry.</span>
Henry,
Ætheling and Count, if not one of the party, was not far
off; he too had, if not his visions, at least his omens.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_782" id="fnanchor_782"></a><a href="#footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Walter Tirel.</span>
But chief among the company, nearest, it would seem,
to the King in sportive intercourse, was one who was
perhaps his subject in Normandy by birth, perhaps his
subject in England by tenure, but whose chief possessions,
as well as his feelings, belonged to another
land.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_783" id="fnanchor_783"></a><a href="#footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></span>
This was a baron of France, whom we once
<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pageno">322</span>
before heard of in better company, but whom the fame
of the Red King’s boundless liberality had led into his
service. <span class="sni">His father the Dean of Evreux.</span>
In days before the stern laws of Hildebrand
were strictly enforced, a churchman of high rank, Fulk,
Dean of Evreux, was, seemingly by a lawful marriage,
the father of a large family. Walter, one of his sons,
bore the personal surname of <span class="title">Tirel</span>, <span class="title">Tyrell</span>, in many
spellings, pointing perhaps to his skill in drawing the
bow. <span class="sni">His lordships and marriage.</span>
He became, by whatever means, lord of Poix in
Ponthieu, and of Achères by the Seine between Pontoise
and Poissy; at the former of these lordships, it would
seem, he had once been the host of Anselm.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_784" id="fnanchor_784"></a><a href="#footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></span>
He was
not, in the days of the Survey at least, a land-owner of
much account in England. A small lordship in Essex,
held under Richard of Clare, is the only entry under any
name by which he can be conceived to be meant. He
had married a wife, Adelaide by name, of the great line
of Giffard, who seems to have lived till the latter days
of King Henry. He was now a near friend of the Red
King’s, a special sharer with him in the sports of the
forest, so much so that, when legend came to attribute
the laying waste of Hampshire to the younger instead
of the elder William, Walter Tirel was charged with
having been the adviser of the deed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_785" id="fnanchor_785"></a><a href="#footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni"><dfn>Gab</dfn> of the King and Walter Tirel.</span>
On the Wednesday of Fulchered’s sermon, the King
and his chosen comrade were talking familiarly. Walter
fell into that kind of discourse which is called in the
Old-French tongue by the expressive words <dfn>gaber</dfn> and
<dfn>gab</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_786" id="fnanchor_786"></a><a href="#footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a></span>
He began to talk big, to jeer at the King for the
small results of his own big talk. But the matter of
<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pageno">323</span>
the discourse sounds a little strange, if it was really
uttered at a moment when such great preparations were
making for the defence of Normandy, for the purchase
of Aquitaine, perhaps for the conquest of Anjou, to say
nothing of schemes greater and further off. <span class="sni">Walter jeers at the king.</span>
The lord of
Poix asked the King why he did nothing; with his vast
power, why did he not attack some neighbour? Great
as the Red King’s power was, Walter is made to speak
of it as a good deal greater than the truth, so much so
indeed that we can read the speech only as mockery.
<span class="sni">William’s alleged subjects and allies.</span>
All William’s men were ready at his call, the men of

the Burgundians held him for their king; Eustace of
Boulogne would do anything at his bidding.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_789" id="fnanchor_789"></a><a href="#footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></span>
Why did
he not make war on somebody? Why did he not go forth

The King answers

turn back to the West, and will keep his next Christmas
feast at Poitiers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_790" id="fnanchor_790"></a><a href="#footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Angry words of Walter.</span>
The mocking vein of Walter Tirel
now turns to anger; he bursts forth in wrathful words.
It would be a great matter indeed to go to the mountains
and thence back to Poitiers in time for Christmas.
<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pageno">324</span>
Burgundians and French would indeed deserve to die
by the worst of deaths, if they became subjects to the
English.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_791" id="fnanchor_791"></a><a href="#footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Illustrative value of the story.</span>
This talk, put into the mouth of the King and his
chosen comrade by a writer of the next generation, is in
every way remarkable. The King’s boast that he would
keep Christmas at Poitiers is found also in an earlier
writer, and it is almost implied in his preparations for
taking possession of Aquitaine.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_792" id="fnanchor_792"></a><a href="#footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></span>
The words about
French and Burgundians becoming subject to the English
might sound more in harmony with the next generation;
but we have already seen examples which show
that, even so soon after the Norman Conquest of England,
the English name was beginning to be applied on
continental lips to all the subjects of the English crown.
The armies of William Rufus were English in the same
sense in which the armies of Justinian were Roman.
The threat of a King of England, speaking on English
ground, to overrun all the provinces of Gaul is conceived
as calling forth a feeling of patriotic anger in the
lord of Poix and Achères. Yet, while we might have
expected such an one to fight valiantly for Ponthieu
or the Vexin against a Norman invader, we might also
have expected him to be quite indifferent to the fate
of Poitiers, indifferent at all events to its transfer from
the Aquitanian to the Norman William. The speech
<a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pageno">325</span>
is followed by words which imply that the King’s
boast was taken more seriously than it was meant,
and which almost suggest a plot on Walter’s part for
the King’s destruction.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_793" id="fnanchor_793"></a><a href="#footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></span>
In the crowd of conflicting
tales with which we are now dealing, we must not insist
on any one as a trustworthy statement of undoubted
facts; but the dialogue which is put into the
mouths of William Rufus and Walter Tirel is almost
as remarkable if we look on it as the invention of the
rimer himself as if we deem it to have been, in its
substance, really spoken by those into whose mouths
it is put.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Last day of William Rufus. August 2, 1100.</span>
Of the events of the next day we may say thus much
with certainty; “Thereafter on the morrow after Lammas
day was the King William in hunting from his own men
with an arrow offshot, and then to Winchester brought
and in the bishopric buried.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_794" id="fnanchor_794"></a><a href="#footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Statement of the Chronicle.</span>
These words of our own
Chronicler state the fact of the King’s death and its
manner; they suggest treason, but they do not directly
assert it; they name no one man as the doer. <span class="sni">Other versions; Walter Tirel mentioned in most.</span>
Nearly
all the other writers agree in naming Walter Tirel as
the man who drew the bow; but they agree also in
making his act chance-medley and not wilful murder.
Yet it is clear that there were other tales afloat of which
we hear merely the echoes. <span class="sni">Ralph of Aix.</span>
One tradition attributed the
blow, not to Walter Tirel, but to a certain Ralph of Aix.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_795" id="fnanchor_795"></a><a href="#footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></span>
<a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><span class="pageno">326</span>
As the tale is commonly told, the details of the King’s
death could have been known from no mouth but that of
Walter himself; <span class="sni">The charge denied by Walter.</span>
yet it is certain that Walter himself,
long after, when he had nothing to hope or fear one
way or the other, denied in the most solemn way that
he had any share in the deed or any knowledge of it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_796" id="fnanchor_796"></a><a href="#footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></span>
The words of the Chronicler, though they suggest treason,
do not shut out chance-medley; they leave the actor perfectly
open. <span class="sni">Estimate of the received tale.</span>
There is nothing in the received tale which
is in the least unlikely; but it is the kind of tale which,
even if untrue, might easily grow up. William may
have died by accident by the hand of Walter Tirel or of
any other. He may also have died by treason by the
hand of Walter Tirel or of any other. In this last case
there were many reasons why no inquiries should have
been made, many reasons why the received tale should
be invented or adopted. It was just such a story as was
wanted in such a case. It satisfied curiosity by naming a
particular actor, while it named an actor who was out of
reach, and did not charge even him with any real guilt.
In favour of the same story is the statement, which can
hardly be an invention, that Walter Tirel fled after the
King’s death. But this was a case in which a man who
was innocent even of chance-medley might well flee from
the fear of a suspicion of treason. And Walter’s own
solemn denial may surely go for as much as any mere
suspicion against him. Guesses in such a case are easy;
the slayer may have been a friend of Henry, a friend of
Anselm, a man goaded to despair by oppression&mdash;&#8203;all
such guesses are likely enough in themselves; there is
no evidence for any of them. All that can be said is
that the words of the Chronicle certainly seem to point
<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pageno">327</span>
out the actor, whether guilty or only unlucky, as belonging
to the King’s immediate following. <span class="sni">The statement of the Chronicle the only safe one.</span>
“The King
William was in hunting from his own men by an arrow
offshot.” Beyond that we cannot go with certainty.
But the number of men of every class who must have
felt that they would be the better, if an arrow or any
other means of death could be brought to light on the
Red King, must have been great indeed. <span class="sni">Wonder that he was not killed sooner.</span>
The real
wonder is, not that the shaft struck him in the thirteenth
year of his reign, but that no hand had stricken
him long before.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Accounts of the King’s last day.</span>
Of the last day of the Red King, Thursday, the second
day of August, we have two somewhat minute pictures
which belong to different hours of the day. There is no
contradiction between the two; the two may be read as
an unbroken story; but we have that slight feeling of
distrust which cannot fail to arise when it is clear that
he who records the events of the afternoon knew nothing
of the events of the morning. The details of such a
day would be sure to be remembered; for the same
reason they ran a special chance of being coloured and
embellished. We shall therefore do well to go through
the details of the earlier hours of that memorable day
as we find them written, not forgetting the needful
cautions, but at the same time not forgetting that the
tale has much direct evidence for it and has no direct
evidence against it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_797" id="fnanchor_797"></a><a href="#footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Morning of August 2.</span>
The King then, even according to those who do not
assign the specially fearful vision to himself, passed a
restless night, disturbed by dreams which, on this milder
showing, were ugly enough. <span class="sni">William’s dreams.</span>
He dreamed that he was
bled&mdash;&#8203;a process which in those days seems to have passed
<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pageno">328</span>
for a kind of amusement&mdash;&#8203;and that the blood gushed up
towards heaven, so as to shut out the light of day.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_798" id="fnanchor_798"></a><a href="#footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></span>
He
woke suddenly with the name of our Lady on his lips;
he bade a light to be brought, and bade his chamberlains
not to leave him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_799" id="fnanchor_799"></a><a href="#footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></span>
He remained awake till daybreak.
<span class="sni">Robert Fitz-hamon tells the monk’s dream.</span>
Then, according to this version, came Robert Fitz-hamon,
entitled to do so as being in his closest confidence,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_800" id="fnanchor_800"></a><a href="#footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></span>
and told him the dream of the monk from beyond sea.
William was moved; but he tried to hide his real feelings
under the usual guise of mockery; <span class="sni">William’s mocking answer.</span>
“He is a monk,” he
said with his rude laugh, “he is a monk; monklike he
dreams for the sake of money; give him a hundred shillings.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_801" id="fnanchor_801"></a><a href="#footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></span>
Here we see the boasted liberality which recklessly
squandered with one hand what was wrung from
the groaning people with the other. <span class="sni">His disturbance of mind.</span>
Seriously disturbed
in mind, William doubted whether he should go hunting
that morning; his friends urged him to run no risk, lest
the dream should come true. <span class="sni">His morning.</span>
He therefore, to occupy his
restless mind, gave the forenoon to serious business;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_802" id="fnanchor_802"></a><a href="#footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></span>
there
was enough of it on hand, if he was planning a march
to Rome or even a march to Poitiers. The early dinner
<a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><span class="pageno">329</span>
of those days presently came; he ate and drank more
than usual, hoping thus to stifle and drown the thoughts
that pressed upon him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_803" id="fnanchor_803"></a><a href="#footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a></span>
In this attempt he seems to
have succeeded; after his meal he went forth on his
hunting.</p>

<p><span class="sni">He sets forth to hunt.</span>
At this point we take up the thread of the other story.
The King, after his meal, has regained his spirits, and,
surrounded by his followers and flatterers, he is making
ready for the chase. <span class="sni">The new arrows.</span>
He was putting on his boots&mdash;&#8203;boots
doubtless of no small price&mdash;&#8203;when a smith drew
near, offering him six new <em>catapults</em>, arrows, it would
seem, designed, not for the long bow, but for the more
deadly arbalest or cross-bow.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_804" id="fnanchor_804"></a><a href="#footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></span>
The King joyfully took
them; he praised the work of the craftsman; he kept
four for himself, and gave two to Walter Tirel. <span class="sni">He gives two of them to Walter Tirel.</span>
“Tis
right,” he said, “that the sharpest arrows should be
given to him who knows how to deal deadly strokes
with them.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_805" id="fnanchor_805"></a><a href="#footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></span>
The two went on talking and jesting; the
flatterers of the King joined in admiringly. <span class="sni">Abbot Serlo’s letter.</span>
Suddenly
there came a monk from Gloucester charged with a letter
from Abbot Serlo. The letter told the dream of the monk,
in which the Holy Church had been seen calling on her
Lord for vengeance on the evil deeds of the King of the
English. The letter was read to the King<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_806" id="fnanchor_806"></a><a href="#footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;there was
a future king not far off who could read letters for himself.
<span class="sni">William’s mockery.</span>
William burst into his bitter laugh; he turned to his
favourite comrade; “Walter, do thou do justice, according
<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pageno">330</span>
to these things which thou hast heard.” “So I will, my
lord,” answered Walter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_807" id="fnanchor_807"></a><a href="#footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></span>
Then the King talks more at
length about the Abbot’s letter. “I wonder at my lord
Serlo’s fancy for writing all this; I always thought him
a good old abbot. ’Tis very simple of him, when I have
so much business about, to take the trouble to put the
dreams of his snoring monks into writing and to send
them to me all this way. <span class="sni">His sneers at English regard for omens.</span>
Does he think I am like the
English, who throw up their journey or their business
because of the snoring or the dreams of an old woman?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_808" id="fnanchor_808"></a><a href="#footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></span>
This speech has a genuine sound; it should be noticed
as being the only speech put into the mouth of William
Rufus which can be construed as expressing any dislike
or scorn for his English subjects as such. Yet the words
are rather words of good-humoured raillery than expressive
of any deeper feeling. The Red King oppressed
and despised all men, except his own immediate following.
Practically his oppression and scorn must have
fallen most heavily on men of native English birth; but
there is no sign that he purposely picked them out as
objects of any special persecution.</p>

<p><span class="sni">William and his companions go to the hunt.</span>
In the version which records this speech the sneer
at the English regard for omens are the Red King’s
last recorded words. He now mounted his horse and
rode into a wooded part of the forest to seek his
sport, the sport of those to whom the sufferings of
the wearied, wounded, weeping, beast are a source
of joy. Count Henry the King’s brother,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_809" id="fnanchor_809"></a><a href="#footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></span>
William of
Breteuil, and other nobles, went forth to the hunt, and
<a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pageno">331</span>
were scattered about towards different points. <span class="sni">The King and Walter Tirel.</span>
The King
and the lord of Poix kept together, with a few companions,
some say; others say that they two only kept
together.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_810" id="fnanchor_810"></a><a href="#footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The King shot by an arrow.</span>
The sun was sinking towards the west when
an arrow struck the King; he fell, and his reign and life
were ended. This is all that we can say with positive
certainty. That the arrow came from the bow of Walter
Tirel is a feature common to nearly every account; but
all the details differ. <span class="sni">Various versions.</span>
In one highly picturesque version,
not only the King and Walter Tirel,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_811" id="fnanchor_811"></a><a href="#footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></span>
but a company of
barons are in a thickly wooded part of the forest near a
marsh. The herd of deer comes near; the King gets
down from his horse to take better aim; the barons get
down also, Walter Tirel among them. Walter places himself
near an elder-tree, behind an aspen. A great stag
passes by; an arrow badly aimed pierces the King; by
whose hand it was sent the teller of the tale knew not;
but the archers who were there said that the shaft came
from the bow of Walter Tirel. Walter fled at once; the
King fell. He thrice cried for the Lord’s body. <span class="sni">Alleged devotion of the King at the last moment.</span>
But
there was none to give it to him; the place was a wilderness
far from any church. But a hunter took herbs and
flowers and made the King eat, deeming this to be a
communion. Such a strange kind of figure of the most
solemn act of Christian worship was not unknown.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_812" id="fnanchor_812"></a><a href="#footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></span>
Our author charitably hopes that it might be accepted in
the case of the Red King, especially as he had received
holy bread&mdash;&#8203;itself a substitute of the same kind&mdash;&#8203;the
Sunday before.</p>

<p>In this version there is no mention of the warning
<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a><span class="pageno">332</span>
dreams either of the King or of any other person. The
scene in the wood follows at once on the boasting discourse
with Walter Tirel. <span class="sni">Another version;</span>
In another version the King
has the frightful dream; he receives, and receives in a
good spirit, the warning interpretation of the Bishop.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_813" id="fnanchor_813"></a><a href="#footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></span>
His companions, knights and valets, make ready for the
chase; they are mounted on their horses; the bows are
ready; the dogs are following; the dogs bark; the
horns blow; all is ready that could stir up the soul of the
hunter. <span class="sni">William unwilling to go to the hunt.</span>
The King is unwilling to stir; his companions
tempt him, entreat him, jeer at him; it is time to set
out; he is afraid. He tells them solemnly that he is
sick and sad a hundredfold more than they wot of. The
end is come; he will not go to the forest. They think
that he is mocking, and at last constrain him to come.
The chase is described; the King seems to be alone
with one unnamed companion. <span class="sni">He is shot by accident by a knight unnamed.</span>
The King calls on his
comrade to shoot; he is frightened as being too near
the King. He shoots; the devil guides the barbed arrow
so that it glances from a bough, and pierces the King
near the heart. <span class="sni">He dies penitent.</span>
He has just strength enough to bid the
knight to flee for his own life, and to pray to God for
him who has lost his life by his own folly, and who has
been so great a sinner against God. The knight rides
off in bitter grief, wishing a hundred times that he had
himself been killed instead of the King.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Tenderness towards Rufus in these two versions.</span>
In these versions, both written in the Red King’s own
tongue, the details are very remarkable. They seem to
come from a kind of wish, like the feeling which strewed
flowers on the grave of Nero, to make the end of the
oppressor and blasphemer one degree less frightful.
Other versions know nothing of this conversion at the
last moment. In one of them, the two, the King and
Walter, are alone; the King shoots at a stag; he hits
<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><span class="pageno">333</span>
the beast, but only with a slight wound. <span class="sni">Other versions mention Walter Tirel.</span>
The stag flies;
the King follows him with his eyes, sheltering them with
his hand from the sun’s rays. Walter Tirel meanwhile
aims at another stag, misses him, and strikes the King.
Rufus utters no word; like Harold, he breaks off the shaft
of the arrow; he falls on the ground, and dies. Walter
comes up, finds him lifeless, and takes to flight.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_814" id="fnanchor_814"></a><a href="#footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></span>
Or again,
the stag comes between his two enemies; Walter shoots;
the King at the same moment shifts his place; Walter’s
arrow flies over the stag’s back, and pierces the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_815" id="fnanchor_815"></a><a href="#footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></span>
In another version the arrow, as we have already heard,
glances from a tree;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_816" id="fnanchor_816"></a><a href="#footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></span>
in another the King stumbles and
falls upon it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_817" id="fnanchor_817"></a><a href="#footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></span>
In later but not less graphic accounts
the string of the King’s bow breaks; the stag stands
still in amazement; the King calls to Walter, “Shoot,
you devil,” “Shoot, in the devil’s name; shoot, or it will
be the worse for you.” Walter shoots; his arrow, perhaps
by a straight course, perhaps by glancing against a
tree, strikes the King to the heart.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_818" id="fnanchor_818"></a><a href="#footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></span></p>

<p>In all these versions the arrow comes from the bow of
a known companion, and in all but one that companion is
said to be Walter Tirel. In another form of the story the
general outline is the same, but the persons are different.
<span class="sni">Dunstable version.</span>
The vision which in the other version is seen at Gloucester
is moved to Dunstable, and is seen there by the prior of
that house. The change of place is unlucky, as the
<a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><span class="pageno">334</span>
priory of Dunstable was not yet founded.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_819" id="fnanchor_819"></a><a href="#footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The dream with new details.</span>
The Prince
on his throne, and the fair woman complaining of the
deeds of William Rufus, are seen, with some differences of
detail, but quite a new element is brought in. A man all
black and hairy offers five arrows to the Prince on the
throne, who gives them back again to him, saying that
on the morrow the wrongs of the suppliant woman shall
be avenged by one of them. The Prior has the vision
explained to him much as in the other versions of the
story, but with the addition that, unless the King repented,
the woman&mdash;&#8203;the Church&mdash;&#8203;would be avenged by
one of the arrows on the morrow. <span class="sni">The prior of Dunstable warns the King.</span>
The Prior starts
from his sleep, and midnight as it was, he sets out at
once on a journey to the New Forest, as swift and headlong
as the King’s own ride to Southampton the year
before. He reaches the place at one in the afternoon,
and finds the King going forth to hunt. As soon as
William sees him, he says that he knows why he is
come, and orders forty marks to be given to him. For,
it is added, the King, who destroyed other churches
throughout all England, had a love for the church of
Dunstable and its prior, and had even built the minster
there at his own cost. The Prior says that he has come
on much greater and weightier matters; he takes the
King aside; he tells him his dream, and warns him on
no account to go into the forest, but at once to begin to
repent and amend his ways. The Prior has hardly
ended his discourse when a man, like the man whom he
had seen in his dream, comes and offers the King five
arrows, like the arrows of the dream. <span class="sni">The King shot by Ralph of Aix.</span>
The King gives
them&mdash;&#8203;not to Walter Tirol, who is not mentioned, but to
Ralph of Aix, to take with him into the forest. The
Prior meanwhile prays him not to go, but in vain. He
goes into the wood, and is presently shot with one of
<a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><span class="pageno">335</span>
those arrows by the hand of Ralph. No details are
given, nor is it implied whether the King’s death was an
act of murder or of chance-medley.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Impression made at the time by the death of Rufus.</span>
These varying tales, whose very variety shows the
impression which the event made upon men’s minds, may
make us glad to come back to the safe statement of the
Chronicler, that the Red King was shot from his own
men. The place and circumstances of the death of
Rufus were such as could not fail to stamp themselves
upon men’s minds. We see the proud and godless King,
in the height of his pride and godlessness, with his heart
puffed up with wilder plans and more swelling boasts
than any of his plans and boasts in former years. He
goes forth, in defiance of all warning&mdash;&#8203;for some kernel
of truth there must surely be in so many tales of
warning&mdash;&#8203;to take his pleasure in the place which men
had already learned to look on as fatal to his house, the
place where his brother had died by a mysterious death,
where his nephew had died only a few weeks before his

his restless soul with business, and then to quench all

<span class="sni">Its abiding memory.</span>
And the impression was
not only at the time; it has been abiding. The death of
William Rufus is one of those events in English history
which are familiar to every memory and come readily to
every mouth. His death lives in the thoughts of not a
few who have no clear knowledge of his life. The arrow
in the New Forest is well known to many who know
nothing of the real position of the Red King’s reign in
English history. The name of Walter Tirel springs
readily to the lips of many on whose ears the names of
Randolf Flambard and Robert of Bellême, of Helias of
Maine and Malcolm of Scotland, nay the name of
Anselm himself, would fall like unwonted sounds. <span class="sni">Local traditions.</span>
No
keener local remembrance can be found than that which
binds together the name of Rufus and the name of the
New Forest. At the scenes of the great events of his
reign, at Rochester and Bamburgh and Le Mans, local
memory has passed away, and the presence of the Red
King has to be called up by book-learning only. In a
word, in popular remembrance William Rufus lives, not
in his life but in his death. Nor is this wonderful. <span class="sni">Impressive character of the death of Rufus.</span>
In
the widest survey of his reign, we can only say that his
death was the fitting ending of his life; in a life full of
striking incident, it is not amazing that the last and
<a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a><span class="pageno">337</span>
most striking incident of all should be the best remembered.
<span class="sni">Rufus and Charles the First.</span>
Of all the endings of kings in our long history,
the two most impressive are surely the two that are most
opposite. There is the death of the king who fell suddenly
in the height of his power, by an unknown hand in
the thickest depths of the forest; and there is the death
of the king who, fallen from his power, was brought
forth to die by the stroke of the headsman, before the
windows of his own palace, in the sight of his people and
of the sun. The striking nature of the tale is worthy
of its long remembrance; but one could almost wish
that the name of the supposed actor in the death of
Rufus had never attached itself to the story. <span class="sni">The words of the Chronicle.</span>
The dark
words of the Chronicle are in truth more impressive
than the tale, true or false, of Walter Tirel. Rufus was
shot in his hunting from his own men. That is enough;
his day was over. <span class="sni">End and character of Rufus.</span>
A life was ended, stained with deeds
which, in our history at least, stand out without fellow
before or after, but a life in which we may here and there
see signs of great powers wasted, even of momentary
feelings which might have been trained into something
nobler. As it is, the career of William the Red is one of
which the kindest words that we can say are that he
always kept his word when it was plighted in a certain
form, and that he was less cruel in his own person than
many men of his time, than some better men than himself.
<span class="sni">Judgement on the reign of Rufus.</span>
But, however we judge of the man, there is but one
judgement to be passed on the reign. The arrow, by
whomsoever shot, set England free from oppression such
as she never felt before or after at the hand of a
single man.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Alleged final penitence of Rufus.</span>
One tale of the death of Rufus, it will be remembered,
charitably describes him as seeking at the last for the
mercy of the God whom he had so often defied. Others
<a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pageno">338</span>
paint him as stubborn to the end, and put the name of
the fiend in his mouth as his last words. <span class="sni">The other version prevails.</span>
The latter
version is the one which left its abiding remembrance;
it is the one which all men accepted at the time as the
true picture of the oppressor whose yoke was broken at
that memorable Lammas-tide. <span class="sni">Accounts of William’s burial.</span>
But the versions which
try to assert a repentance for William Rufus at the last
moment try also to claim for him a solemn and honourable
burial amid the tears of mourning friends. One
story goes so far as to place at the head of the assembly
the late Bishop of the diocese, Walkelin of Winchester,
whose body was already resting in the Old Minster,
while the revenues of his see were in the hands of the
King. This version gives us a vivid picture of the scene
which followed the King’s death.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_822" id="fnanchor_822"></a><a href="#footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></span>
A company of barons
gather round the corpse. There were the sons of Richard
of Bienfaite, pointedly distinguished, the one as <em>Earl</em>, the
other only as <em>Lord</em>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_823" id="fnanchor_823"></a><a href="#footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></span>
There were Gilbert of Laigle and
Robert Fitz-hamon, names familiar to us, and William
of Montfichet, a name afterwards well known, but
which is not enrolled in Domesday. These lords weep
and rend their hair; they beat themselves and wish they
were dead; they could never have such another lord.
Gilbert of Laigle at last bids them turn from vainly
lamenting the lord who could not come back to them to
paying the last honours to what was left of him. The
huntsmen make a bier; they strew it with flowers and
fern; they lay it on two palfreys; they place the corpse
on the bier and cover it with the new mantles of Robert
Fitz-hamon and William of Montfichet. Then they bear
him to the minster of Saint Swithhun, where bishops,
<a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a><span class="pageno">339</span>
abbots, clerks, and monks, a goodly company, are come
together. Bishop Walkelin, strange to say, watches by
the body of the King till the morning. Then it is
buried with such worship, such saying of masses, as no
man had ever heard before, such as no man would
hear again till the day of doom.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The genuine story.</span>
Such is the tale of those who would soften down the
story; but the version which bears on it the stamp of
truth gives us quite another picture. The King, forsaken
by his nobles and companions, lay dead in the
forest, as little cared for as his father had been when he
lay dead in his chamber at Saint Gervase. Those who
had been his comrades in sport hastened hither and
thither to their own homes, to guard them against
troubles that might arise, now that the land had no
longer a ruler. Only a few churls of the neighbourhood,
men of the race at whom Rufus had sneered for heeding
omens and warnings, were, now that omens and warnings
had proved too true, ready to do the last corporal
work of mercy to the oppressor. They laid the bleeding
body on a rustic wain; they covered it as they could,
with coarse cloths, and then took it, dripping blood as it
went, to the gates of Winchester. He who had so dearly
loved the sports of the woods was himself borne from
the woods to the city, like a savage boar pierced through
by the hunting-spear.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_824" id="fnanchor_824"></a><a href="#footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></span>
And now took place one of the
most wonderful scenes that our history records.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_825" id="fnanchor_825"></a><a href="#footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Popular canonizations.</span>
That
history records not a few cases of popular canonization;
neither pope nor king could hinder Earl Waltheof and Earl
Simon from working signs and wonders on behalf of the
<a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a><span class="pageno">340</span>
folk for whom they had died.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_826" id="fnanchor_826"></a><a href="#footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Popular excommunication of Rufus.</span>
But nowhere else do we
read of a popular excommunication. William Rufus, as
I have more than once remarked, had never been openly
cut off from the communion of the Church. He had
died indeed unshriven and unabsolved, but so had many
a better man in the endless struggles of those rough
days. There was no formal ground for refusing to his
corpse or to his soul the rites, the prayers, the offerings,
which were the portion of the meanest of the faithful.
But a common thought came on the minds of all men that
for William Rufus those charitable rites could be of none
avail. His foul life, his awful death, was taken as a sign
that he was smitten by a higher judgement than that of
Popes and Councils. A crowd of all orders, ranks, and
sexes, brought together by wonder or pity&mdash;&#8203;we will not
deem that they came in scorn or triumph&mdash;&#8203;met the humble
funeral procession, and followed the royal corpse to the
Old Minster. <span class="sni">He is buried in the Old Minster without religious rites.</span>
The dead man had been a king; the consecrating
oil had been poured on his head; his body was
therefore allowed to pass within the hallowed walls, and
was laid with all speed in a grave beneath the central
tower. But in those rites, at once sad and cheerful, which
accompany the burial of the lowliest of baptized men,
the lord of England and Normandy had no share. No
bell was rung; no mass was said; no offerings were
made for the soul which was deemed to have passed
beyond the reach even of eternal mercy. No man took
from the hoard which Rufus had filled by wrong to win the
prayers of the poor for him by almsgiving. Men deemed
that for him prayer was too late; no scattering abroad
of the treasure by the hands of others could atone for
the wrong by which the treasure had first been brought
together. Many looked on; but few mourned. None
wept for him but the mercenaries who received his pay,
<a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pageno">341</span>
and the baser partners of his foul vices. They would
gladly have torn his slayer in pieces, but he was already
far away out of their reach. Thus unwept, unprayed
for, a byeword, an astonishment, and a hissing, the Red
King lay beneath the pavement of the minster of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithhun. <span class="sni">Fall of the tower. 1107.</span>
A few years later the tower under which
he lay crumbled and fell. Men said that it fell because
so foul a corpse lay beneath it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_827" id="fnanchor_827"></a><a href="#footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Portents at William’s death.</span>
But as portents had gone before the fall of the Red King,
so portents did not wait for the crumbling of Walkelin’s
tower to startle men in strange ways with the news
that he had fallen. That news, so say the legends of the
time, was known in strange ways in far-off places, long
before the tidings could have been brought by the utmost
speed of man; sooner, it would seem, than the moment
when the arrow hit its designed or unwitting mark.
<span class="sni">Dream of Abbot Hugh of Clugny. July 31, 1100.</span>

throne of God, accused, judged, and condemned to eternal

<span class="sni">News brought to Anselm’s clerk. August 2.</span>

is dead.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_830" id="fnanchor_830"></a><a href="#footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a></span>
Within our own island the news was said to
have been spread abroad in yet stranger ways. <span class="sni">Vision of Count William of Mortain. August 2.</span>
At the
same hour when King William went forth to hunt in the
New Forest, his cousin Count William of Mortain went
forth for his sport also in some of his hunting-grounds in
Cornwall. He too found himself by chance alone, apart
from any of his comrades. No archer from Poix crossed
his path, but a sight far more fearful. A huge goat,
shaggy and black, met him, bearing on his back a king&mdash;&#8203;how
was his kingship marked?--black and naked, and
wounded in the midst of his breast. The Count adjured
the beast in the holiest name to say what all this meant.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_831" id="fnanchor_831"></a><a href="#footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></span>
The power of speech was not lacking to the monster. “I
bear,” he answered, “your king, rather your tyrant, William
the Red, to his doom. For I am the evil spirit, I am
the avenger of the wickedness with which he raged against
the Church of Christ, and I brought about his death,
at the bidding of the blessed Alban, protomartyr of England,
who made his moan to the Lord, because this man
sinned beyond measure in the island which he had been
the first to hallow.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_832" id="fnanchor_832"></a><a href="#footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></span>
From what mint this wild tale
<a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pageno">343</span>
comes it is needless to add. The house of Saint Alban
was only one of thirteen abbeys which the King had
kept vacant to receive their revenues.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_833" id="fnanchor_833"></a><a href="#footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></span>
But the other
twelve were less rich in that special growth both of
legend and of genuine history which adorns the house
of the protomartyr.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Vacancy of the throne.</span>
The throne was again vacant; and now came the
question which Englishmen knew so well whenever
the throne was vacant, Whom should they choose to
fill it? <span class="sni">Claims of Robert by the treaty of 1091.</span>
There was indeed an instrument in being,
dated nine years before, by which it had been agreed
that, if either Robert or William died without lawful
issue, the survivor should succeed to the dominions of
his brother.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_834" id="fnanchor_834"></a><a href="#footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Such claims little regarded.</span>
But Englishmen had never allowed their
most precious birthright to be thus lightly signed away
beforehand. And many men of Norman birth must by
this time have put on the feelings of Englishmen on this
point as on many others. With the great mass of both
races there could have been no doubt at all as to the
right man to place upon the vacant throne. <span class="sni">Choice confined to the house of the Conqueror.</span>
By this
time, we may be sure, all thought had passed away of
choosing outside the line of the Conqueror; and if such
<a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a><span class="pageno">344</span>
a thought had come into the head of any man, there
was no candidate who could have been brought forward.
<span class="sni">No thought of either Eadgar.</span>
The elder Eadgar was far away on his crusade, and no
one was likely to think of sending to Scotland to offer
the crown to his nephew. His nieces were near at hand;
but the thought of a female ruler did not come into men’s
minds till the next generation. Within the house of
the Conqueror there were two claimants. <span class="sni">Choice between Robert and Henry.</span>
Robert had
whatever right the treaty could give him, a better right
undoubtedly than any which he could put forward as
the eldest son of his father. But a paper claim of this
kind went for little when the man who asserted it was
far away, and when, had he been at hand, everything
except the letter of the treaty was against him. It went
for naught when there, on the very spot, was the man
whom every sign marked out for kingship. <span class="sni">Claims of Henry; the only son of a king.</span>
There among
them was the only man&mdash;&#8203;unless indeed they had gone to
Norway to seek for the younger Harold&mdash;&#8203;who was the son
of a crowned King of the English. There was the one
man of the reigning house who, born on English soil of
the Norman stock, could be looked on as a countryman
by Normans and English alike. <span class="sni">His personal merits.</span>
There was the man
who, while his brothers had, in different ways, so deeply
misgoverned on their several sides of the sea, had shown,
by his wise rule of a small dominion, how far better
suited he was than either of them to be entrusted with
the rule of a mighty kingdom. The Count of the
Côtentin, Henry the Ætheling, Henry the Clerk, was
the man whose name spoke alike to English and to Norman
hearts. To the Normans he was the son of their
conquering Duke, the descendant of the dukes that had
been before him, the man who had made one spot of
Norman ground prosperous while anarchy tore the rest
in pieces. To the English he was their own Ætheling,
the one son of their king, their countryman, as they
<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pageno">345</span>
fondly deemed, speaking the tongue of Ælfred, sent to
renew the law of Eadward. With such a candidate at
their doors, the bit of diplomatic parchment was torn to
the winds. No time was to be lost; the land could not
go without a king. <span class="sni">Speedy election of Henry.</span>
The work was done speedily and
decisively. The record which tells how the late king
died in the midst of his unright, without shrift, without
atonement, goes on to say, “On the Thursday was he
slain and on the morrow was he buried; and, after that
he buried was, the Witan that nigh at hand were his
brother Henry to king chose.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_835" id="fnanchor_835"></a><a href="#footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></span></p>

On the day of the Red King’s fall Count Henry was

of his bow broke, that he went to the house of a churl to
get wherewithal to mend it. While the bowstring is
mending, an old woman of the house asks one of the
Count’s companions who his master was. He answers
that he is Henry, brother of the king of the land. She
tells them that she knows by augury that the King’s
brother shall soon be king himself, and bids them remember
her words.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_836" id="fnanchor_836"></a><a href="#footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></span>

A fierce strife arose; a crowd swiftly gathered, and it
was soon seen on which side the feelings of the people
lay. Men pressed together from all quarters to swell the
company of him who in their eyes was the lawful heir
claiming his right. The voice of England&mdash;&#8203;so much of
England as had heard the news&mdash;&#8203;rose high against the
stranger who dared to withstand the English Ætheling,
the son of a crowned king born in the land. Thus, four-and-thirty
years after the great battle, Englishmen still
looked on the son of William Fitz-Osbern, nay on the
<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pageno">347</span>
son of William the Great born to a duke in Normandy,
as outlandish men. But the son of William the Great,
born to a king in their own land, they claimed as
their own countryman. Strengthened by the favour of
the people, the Ætheling put his hand on his sword’s
hilt; he would endure no vain excuses to keep him out
of the inheritance of his father.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_842" id="fnanchor_842"></a><a href="#footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></span>
A stop seems to have
been put to this open strife, perhaps by night, perhaps
by the coming of the lowly funeral pomp of the fallen
king on the Friday morning. <span class="sni">Formal meeting for the election. August 3.</span>

But then the question was settled by a division of the kingdom; now such a
thought is not breathed. The Conqueror had made
England a realm one and indivisible; it was doubtful
to which of his sons it was to pass, but, to whichever it
passed, it was to pass whole. <span class="sni">The divided kingdom now impossible.</span> Unluckily, when debates
concerned the kingdom only, without touching any
ecclesiastical question, no Eadmer or William Fitz-Stephen

Henry was chosen, and he largely owed his
election to one special friend. <span class="sni">influence of Henry Earl of Warwick.</span>
This was his namesake
Henry, Earl of Warwick, the younger son of the old
Roger of Beaumont and brother of the more famous
Count of Meulan, soon to be Earl of Leicester. Earl
Henry and his wife Margaret of Mortagne bear a good
character among the writers of their time, and they seem
to have been designed for a more peaceful age than that
in which their lot was cast. Chiefly by the influence of
Henry of Warwick, Henry of Coutances and Domfront
was chosen to the English crown. The work was almost
as speedy as the burial of Eadward, the election and the
crowning of Harold. Quite as speedy it could not be,
when the Gemót of election was held at Winchester,
while the precedents of three reigns made it seem matter
of necessity that the unction and coronation should be
done at Westminster. Before the sun set on the day
after the death of Rufus, England had again, not indeed
a full king, but an undisputed king-elect.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The hoard opened to the king-elect.</span>
Against a king-elect the gates of the hoard could

Henry’s. His first act was to stop one of the many
sources by which the hoard was filled. One of them
was found in the revenues of the vacant bishopric
of the city in which they were met. Henry, still only
chosen and not crowned, took on him to do one act of
royal authority which all men would hail as a sign that
the new reign was not to be as the last. <span class="sni">He grants the bishopric of Winchester to William Giffard.</span>
As the uncrowned
Ætheling Eadgar had confirmed the election
of Abbot Brand by the monks of Peterborough,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_845" id="fnanchor_845"></a><a href="#footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></span>
so
the uncrowned Ætheling Henry bestowed the staff of
the see of Winchester on the late king’s Chancellor,
William Giffard, doubtless a kinsman of the aged Earl
of Buckingham. In his appointment we may perhaps
see a wish on the part of a king who was emphatically
the choice of the English people to conciliate
at once the Norman nobles and the royal officials.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_846" id="fnanchor_846"></a><a href="#footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></span>
But
seven years were to pass before the bishop-elect appointed
by the king-elect became a full bishop by the
rite of consecration. <span class="sni">Consecrated 1107; died 1129.</span>
And what we should hardly have
looked for in a minister of the Red King, some of
those years were years of confessorship and exile endured
by the new prelate on behalf of an ecclesiastical
principle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_847" id="fnanchor_847"></a><a href="#footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></span></p>

<p>But Henry, Ætheling and Count, was not long to
remain a mere king-elect. The interregnum ended on
<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pageno">350</span>
the fourth day. <span class="sni">Need for hastening the coronation.</span>
It was not a time to tarry; it was needful
that the land should have a full king at the first
moment that the rite of his hallowing could be gone
through. It was known that Robert was on his way back
from Apulia, and Henry and his counsellors feared lest,
if the Duke should show himself in England or even in
Normandy before the crown was safe on the new king’s
brow, the Norman nobles in England might repent of an
election in which it is clear that they had not very
heartily agreed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_848" id="fnanchor_848"></a><a href="#footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></span>
From Winchester therefore Henry
went to London with all speed, in company with Count
Robert of Meulan, who kept under the new reign the
same post of specially trusted counsellor which he had
held during the reign of Rufus.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_849" id="fnanchor_849"></a><a href="#footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Henry crowned at Westminster. August 5, 1100.</span>
On the Sunday after
that memorable Thursday, Count Henry was admitted
to the kingly office in the West Minster. As the Primate
was far away, the rite of consecration was performed
by the highest suffragan of his province, Maurice
Bishop of London.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_850" id="fnanchor_850"></a><a href="#footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Form of his oath.</span>
The form of Henry’s coronation
oath seems, like the oaths of his father and his brother,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_851" id="fnanchor_851"></a><a href="#footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></span>
to have had a special reference to the circumstances of
the time. It is the oath of a reformer, of a king who
has to bring back right after a season of wrong. As the
memory of Rufus had been branded in his burial as the
memory of no other king ever was, so it was branded no
less in the coronation rites of his successor. <span class="sni">He swears to undo the evils of his brother’s reign.</span>
The new
<a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span class="pageno">351</span>
king swore, as usual, to hold the best law that on any
king’s day before him stood; but he swore further to
God and to all folk to put aside the unright that in his
brother’s time was.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_852" id="fnanchor_852"></a><a href="#footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></span>
These weighty promises made,
Bishop Maurice of London hallowed Henry to king, and,
according to the great law of his father, all men in this
land bowed to him and sware oaths and became his
men.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_853" id="fnanchor_853"></a><a href="#footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a></span>
The work was now done; the diplomatic meshes
of nine years before had been broken asunder by the
strong will of the English people. England had again a
king born on her own soil, a king of her own rearing,
her own choosing, King of the English in a truer sense
than those who went either before him or after him for
some generations. <span class="sni">Joy at Henry’s accession.</span>
Great was the gladness as the news
spread through the length and breadth of the land.
The long hopes of the English, the dark sayings of
the Britons, were fulfilled in the coming of the king
sworn before all things to undo the wrongs of the evil
time. The good state was brought back; the golden
age had come again; the days of unlaw had passed
away; the Lion of Justice reigned.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_854" id="fnanchor_854"></a><a href="#footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a><span class="pageno">352</span>
<span class="sni">He puts forth his Charter.</span>
Before the Sunday of his consecration had passed,
King Henry had put the solemn promises which he had
made before the altar into the shape of a legal document.
That very day he set forth in writing that
famous charter which formed the groundwork of the
yet more famous charter of John.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_855" id="fnanchor_855"></a><a href="#footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Its provisions.</span>
I have commented
on its main provisions elsewhere, and I have tried to
show how it at once establishes the new doctrines as to
the tenure of land, and promises to reform the abuses to
which they had already led.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_856" id="fnanchor_856"></a><a href="#footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></span>
I will now go through
its main provisions in order. First, Henry, King of the
English, does his faithful people to wit that he has been
crowned king by the common counsel of the barons of
the whole realm of England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_857" id="fnanchor_857"></a><a href="#footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></span>
He had found the realm
ground down with unrighteous exactions. <span class="sni">The Church to be free;</span>
For the fear
of God and for the love which he has to his people, he
first of all makes the Church of God free. He will not
sell the Church nor put her to farm.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_858" id="fnanchor_858"></a><a href="#footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></span>
<span class="sni">ecclesiastical vacancies.</span>
When an archbishop,
<a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a><span class="pageno">353</span>
bishop, or abbot, dies, he will take nothing during
the vacancy from the demesne of his church or from its
tenants. And he will put away the evil customs with
which the realm of England was oppressed, which evil
customs he goes on to set down in order.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Reliefs.</span>
Secondly, he touches the question of reliefs. The heir
of lands held in chief of the crown shall no longer, as
was done in his brother’s time, be constrained to <em>redeem</em>
his land at an arbitrary price; he shall <em>relieve</em> it by a
just and lawful relief.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_859" id="fnanchor_859"></a><a href="#footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></span>
And as the King does by his
tenants-in-chief, he calls on his tenants-in-chief to do
in their turn by their under-tenants.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Marriage.</span>
Thirdly, he comes to the abuse of the lord’s rights in
the matter of marriage.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_860" id="fnanchor_860"></a><a href="#footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></span>
He will take nothing for
licence of marriage, nor will he meddle with the right of
his tenants to dispose of their daughters or other kinswomen,
unless the proposed bridegroom should be the
King’s enemy. The rights of the childless widow are
also secured.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Wardship.</span>
The fourth clause touches the case of the widow with
children. The mother herself or some fitting kinsman
shall have the wardship.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_861" id="fnanchor_861"></a><a href="#footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></span>
And as the King does by his
barons, so shall they do in the case of the daughters and
widows of their men.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The coinage.</span>
Fifthly, the coinage is to be brought back to the state
in which it was in the days of King Eadward, and
<em>justice</em> is denounced against false moneyers and other
retailers of false coin.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_862" id="fnanchor_862"></a><a href="#footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a></span>
Sharp justice it was, as we know
from the annals of Henry’s reign.</p>

<p><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a><span class="pageno">354</span>
<span class="sni">Debts and suits.</span>
Sixthly, The King forgives all debts owing to his
brother, and stops all suits set on foot by him. This is
not the first time in which it is presumed that claims
made by the crown must be unjust. Henry excepts
debts arising out of the ordinary farming of the crown
lands; he excepts also anything that any man had agreed
to pay for the inheritances or other property of others.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_863" id="fnanchor_863"></a><a href="#footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a></span>
Does this refer to property confiscated and sold by the
King? Payments which had been made in relief for a
man’s own inheritance are specially forgiven.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_864" id="fnanchor_864"></a><a href="#footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Wills.</span>
Seventhly, he confirms the free right of bequest of
personal property. If a man, through warfare or sickness,
dies intestate, his wife, children, kinsfolk, and
lawful men, are to dispose of his money as they may
think best for his soul.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_865" id="fnanchor_865"></a><a href="#footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Amercements.</span>
The eighth provision goes back a step further than
the others. It cancels the practice of both Williams,
and goes back in the most marked way to earlier times.
If one of the King’s barons or other men incurred forfeiture,
he should not bind himself to be at the King’s
mercy, as had been done in the time of his father and
brother; he should be fined a fixed amount according to
custom, as was done in the days of the kings before
his father.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_866" id="fnanchor_866"></a><a href="#footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Murders.</span>
Ninthly, the King forgives all <em>murders</em> up to the day
of his coronation. That is to say, he forgives all payments
due from the hundreds according to the special
<a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pageno">355</span>
law made by his father for the protection of his foreign
followers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_867" id="fnanchor_867"></a><a href="#footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a></span>
For the future the payment shall be according
to the law of King Eadward.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_868" id="fnanchor_868"></a><a href="#footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">The forests.</span>
Tenthly comes the one illiberal provision in the document.
“By the common consent of my barons, I have
kept the forests in my own hands, as my father held
them.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_869" id="fnanchor_869"></a><a href="#footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></span>
Here, where the King’s personal pleasure was
concerned, we hear nothing of the law of King Eadward
or of the practice of yet earlier kings.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Privilege of the knights.</span>
The eleventh clause is a remarkable one. It does not
speak, like the others, of reforming abuses or of going
back to the practice of some earlier time. The King, of
his own free will, bestows a certain privilege on one class
of his subjects. Knights who held their lands by military
service are to be free, as far as their demesne lands
are concerned, from all gelds and other burthens. This
the King grants to them as his own gift. In return for
so great a boon, he calls on them to stand ready with
horses and arms for his service and the defence of his
kingdom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_870" id="fnanchor_870"></a><a href="#footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></span>
This boon seems meant for a class whom it
was very important for Henry to attach to his interest,
the men namely of both races who were of knightly
rank but not higher. Many of them were his tenants-in-chief;
those who held only of other lords were still
his men by virtue of the law of Salisbury. It was his
<a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pageno">356</span>
policy to strengthen both classes in opposition to the
great nobles whom he knew to be disaffected to him. <span class="sni">Effect of the provision.</span>
It
may not be too much to see in this clause of Henry’s
charter an important stage in the developement of an
idea which is peculiar to England, the idea of the gentleman
who has no pretensions to be a nobleman. <span class="sni">Growth of the country gentry.</span>
The
knights of Henry’s charter are the representatives of the
thegns of Domesday, the forerunners of the country
gentlemen of later times. Holding a place between the
great barons and the mass of the people, and again between
the greatest and the smallest of the king’s
tenants-in-chief&mdash;&#8203;largely Norman by descent, but also
largely English&mdash;&#8203;they were well suited to become the
leaders of the people, as they worthily showed themselves
in our early parliaments. Their existence and
importance, as a class separate from the great barons,
did much to establish that distinctive and happy feature
of English political life, which spread freedom over the
whole land, instead of shutting it up within a few
favoured towns. The existence of the knight, as something
separate from the baron, secured, not only his
own freedom, but the freedom of land-owners smaller
than himself. It helped to hinder the growth of the
hard and fast line which in France divided the <dfn>gentilhomme</dfn>
from the <dfn>roturier</dfn>. <span class="sni">Policy of Henry towards the second order.</span>
It was part of the policy of
Henry to raise particular men of this second rank,
while he broke the power of the great barons of the
Conquest. This clause shows that it was also his
policy to strengthen and to win to his side this class
as a class.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The King’s Peace.</span>
Of the other three clauses of the charter, the first two
are general, the last is temporary. The twelfth clause
establishes firm peace through the whole kingdom. The
thirteenth expresses that mixture of old things and new
which marks the time. <span class="sni">The Law of Eadward.</span>
Henry lays down the great
<a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span class="pageno">357</span>
basis of all later English jurisprudence; “I restore to
you the law of King Eadward, with those amendments
which my father made with the consent of his barons.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_871" id="fnanchor_871"></a><a href="#footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></span>
The law of Henry was to be the old law of England,
traditionally called by the name of the king to whose
days men looked back as to the golden age, <span class="sni">The Conqueror’s amendments.</span>
but modified
by the changes, or rather additions, which were brought in
by the few genuine statutes of the Conqueror.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_872" id="fnanchor_872"></a><a href="#footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a></span>
Here, as
throughout, Henry sets forth his full purpose to reign as
an English king, and he carefully puts forward the nature
of his kingship as a strict continuation of the kingship
of Eadward and of the kings before Eadward. <span class="sni">The alleged Laws of Henry.</span>
We
have seen that the collection which goes by the name of
the Laws of Henry is no real code of Henry’s issuing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_873" id="fnanchor_873"></a><a href="#footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></span>
But it breathes the spirit of this clause and of the
other clauses of the charter. It shows how English,
in theory at least, the government of Henry was meant
to be.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Amnesty.</span>
The fifteenth and last clause is a kind of amnesty for
any irregularity which might have happened during the
short interregnum. Two days and parts of two other
days had passed after the peace of King William&mdash;&#8203;if
we may so speak of the days of unlaw&mdash;&#8203;had come
to an end, and before the peace of King Henry had
begun. If any man had during that time taken anything
which belonged to the King or to any one else, he
might restore it without any fine; if he kept it after the
proclamation, he was to be heavily fined.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_874" id="fnanchor_874"></a><a href="#footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Such was the famous charter of Henry, the document
<a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pageno">358</span>
to which Stephen Langton appealed as the birthright of
English freemen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_875" id="fnanchor_875"></a><a href="#footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Witnesses to the charter.</span>
It was witnessed on the day of the
crowning by the bishop who had officiated, Maurice of
London, by Gundulf Bishop (of Rochester), William
Bishop-elect (of Winchester), Henry Earl (of Warwick),
Simon Earl (of Northampton), Walter Giffard, Robert
of Montfort, Roger Bigod, and Henry of Port.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_876" id="fnanchor_876"></a><a href="#footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></span>
Such
names look forward and backward. There is already a
Bigod, forefather of the Earl who would neither go nor
hang.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_877" id="fnanchor_877"></a><a href="#footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></span>
There is a Simon, and if the likeness of names
is merely accidental, the tradition is carried back in
another way when we remember that Earl Simon of
Northampton was the son-in-law of Waltheof.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_878" id="fnanchor_878"></a><a href="#footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a></span>
The
fewness of the names may perhaps show that the coronation
of Henry, celebrated as it was amidst a burst of
popular joy, was but scantily attended by the great men
of the realm. The whole thing was almost as sudden
as the death of Eadward and the election of Harold, and
it did not, like those events, happen while the Witan
were actually in session. The summons, or even the
news, could have gone through a very small part only
of the kingdom. One would be glad to know how men
heard in distant shires, in Henry’s own Yorkshire for
<a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span class="pageno">359</span>
instance, not only that the oppressor was gone, but that
the new king was crowned, pledged by his oath and
his seal to give his land a new time of peace and
righteousness.</p>

<p class="p2">The new King had taken upon himself to undo the
evils of his brother’s reign, to bring back the days
of Eadward, to reign as an English king. One step
towards the restoration of the good state was to fill the
churches which his brother had sacrilegiously kept vacant.
<span class="sni">Appointments to abbeys.</span>
The see of Winchester he had filled already; he now
began to fill the <a name="line359_11" id="line359_11"></a>thirteen abbeys which Rufus had held
in his hands on the day of his death. Several were filled
before the year was out; two at least were filled on the
very day of his coronation. <span class="sni">Saint Eadmund’s and Ely.</span>
These were the abbey of
Saint Eadmund, void by the death of its abbot Baldwin,
and that of Ely, which had stood void for seven years
since the death of the aged abbot Simeon.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_879" id="fnanchor_879"></a><a href="#footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></span>
The staff of
Saint Eadmund was now placed in the hand of Robert, a
young monk of Bec, who is described as a son, seemingly
a natural son, of Earl Hugh of Chester.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_880" id="fnanchor_880"></a><a href="#footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></span>
That of Ely
<a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pageno">360</span>
was given to Richard, another monk of Bec, son of
Richard of Clare.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_881" id="fnanchor_881"></a><a href="#footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></span>
In these appointments and in some
others we again see the need in which Henry stood of
pleasing the great nobles, even at the cost of sinning
against ecclesiastical rule. In the case of the appointment
to Saint Eadmund’s we are distinctly told that the
King’s nomination was made against the will of the
monks, and a little later Anselm thought it his duty to
remove both Robert and Richard from their offices. Two
other prelates, appointed before any long time had passed,
are of greater personal fame. <span class="sni">Herlwin Abbot of Glastonbury. 1100&ndash;1120.</span>
The name of Herlwin of
Caen, who now received the staff of Glastonbury, lives in
local memory as a great builder.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_882" id="fnanchor_882"></a><a href="#footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Faricius Abbot of Abingdon. 1100&ndash;1117.</span>
And the Italian Faricius,
now placed in the vacant stall of Abingdon, figures
among the most renowned abbots of his house, famous
amongst his other merits for his skill in the healing art.
Oddly enough, his skill in this way kept him back from
higher honour. Had Faricius been less cunning in leechcraft,
he might have been Archbishop of Canterbury.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_883" id="fnanchor_883"></a><a href="#footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a></span></p>

<p>But to undo the evils of the days of unlaw and to
<a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pageno">361</span>
reign as an English king, something more was needed
than to put men of Norman, or even Italian, birth in
possession of English abbeys. Towards carrying out
the former of these objects, Henry had a criminal to
punish and a sufferer to restore. Towards carrying
out the second, he had a wife to marry. These three
events pretty well filled up the rest of the year. <span class="sni">Anselm and Flambard.</span>
Henry
had two bishops to deal with, who needed to be dealt
with in two very different ways. They were between
them the living representatives of the late rule of
unright. The one was the embodiment of what its
agents did, the other was the embodiment of what its
victims underwent. The King had promised to put
away the unrighteousnesses of his brother and of Randolf
Flambard; he began by putting away their surviving
author. <span class="sni">Flambard imprisoned in the Tower.</span>
By the advice of those about him, the Bishop of
Durham, the dregs of wickedness, as he is called in the
vigorous words of one of our writers, was sent as a prisoner
to the Tower of London.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_884" id="fnanchor_884"></a><a href="#footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></span>
This was most likely
not the first case, but it is the first recorded case, in
which the great fortress of the Conqueror was used as
a state-prison for great and notable offenders. Randolf
Flambard heads the long list of its unwilling inmates,
few of whom better deserved their place there than he
did. We hear nothing of any claim of ecclesiastical
privilege on behalf of the man who had brought God’s
Church low. Flambard was not allowed the advantage
<a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pageno">362</span>
of any of the legal subtleties which his predecessor in
his see had known how to play off so skilfully, and
which, one would think, he could have played off more
skilfully still. We do not even hear whether the Bishop
of Durham was summoned before any court of any kind.
The accounts read rather as if his imprisonment was
simply a stretch of the royal power in answer to a
popular demand. The Tower may even have been the
best place for Flambard’s safety, as it was the best place
for the safety of Jeffreys, as understood by Jeffreys himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_885" id="fnanchor_885"></a><a href="#footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></span>
The words which say that the act was done by the
advice of those about the King are also worthy of notice.
<span class="sni">The King’s inner council.</span>
The King’s inner council must certainly have contained
the two Beaumont brothers, the subtle Count of Meulan
and the upright Earl of Warwick. It contained Roger the
Bigod, more honoured in his descendants than in himself.
It contained too some of Henry’s old friends from his Norman
fief, Richard of Redvers and Earl Hugh of Chester.
We are told that as soon as the news of the death of Rufus
was known in Normandy, several of the great men who
were there, specially the Earls of Chester and Shrewsbury,
hastened to England to acknowledge Henry.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_886" id="fnanchor_886"></a><a href="#footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a></span>
We
do not find Robert of Bellême among Henry’s inner
counsellors; we do find Hugh of Avranches. And to the
list we may also most likely add the bishop-elect of
Winchester, William Giffard, a tried court official, though
<a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pageno">363</span>
one who afterwards showed that he could suffer for a
principle. <span class="sni">Roger, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury.</span>
And a man who was to be more famous than
all of them, the patriarch of the long line of English
Justiciars and Judges, the poor clerk who was to be
presently the all-powerful Bishop Roger of Salisbury,
may have already given his voice among men who were
as yet so far above him in worldly place.</p>

<p class="p2">We are told that the imprisonment of the Bishop of
Durham was one of two acts which the new King did in
order that nothing might be wanting to the universal
joy at his accession.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_887" id="fnanchor_887"></a><a href="#footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></span>
The other was the recall of the
Archbishop of Canterbury. We have seen that, in legendary
belief at least, the death of Rufus was very
speedily made known, if not to Anselm himself, at least
to his friends.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_888" id="fnanchor_888"></a><a href="#footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The news of the King’s death brought to Anselm.</span>
The news was presently brought to him
in a more ordinary way by two monks, one of Bec, one of
Canterbury. His head-quarters were now at Lyons, but
he was at the moment staying at a monastery called
God’s House.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_889" id="fnanchor_889"></a><a href="#footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a></span>
There the messengers met him, and told
him that King William was dead. Anselm was overwhelmed
at the tidings, and burst forth into the bitterest
weeping. Those who stood by wondered; but he told
them with a voice broken with sobs that, by the truth
which a servant of God ought not to transgress, he
would far rather have died himself than that William
should die as he had died.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_890" id="fnanchor_890"></a><a href="#footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">He is invited to come back by his own monks,</span>
Anselm now went back to Lyons, where another monk
of Canterbury met him, bringing with him a formal letter
from the convent of the metropolitan church, praying
<a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a><span class="pageno">364</span>
him, now that the tyrant was dead, to come back without
delay to comfort his children.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_891" id="fnanchor_891"></a><a href="#footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a></span>
He took counsel with
his friend Archbishop Hugh, and by his advice began
his return to England, to the great grief, we are told, of
the whole city of Lyons and all the lands thereabouts.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_892" id="fnanchor_892"></a><a href="#footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a></span>
<span class="sni">and by the King.</span>
He had not reached Clugny when he was met by
a still more important bearer of tidings. A messenger
came in the name of the new King of the English and
his lords, bearing a royal letter, calling on Anselm to
come back, and even blaming his delay in not coming
sooner.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_893" id="fnanchor_893"></a><a href="#footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Importance of Henry’s letter.</span>
We have its text, every word of which deserves
to be studied, as showing how popular the constitution
of England still was in theory, and what was
the kind of language which had to be used by one who
was called on to play the part of a popular king. Henry,
in setting forth his right to the crown, uses more popular
language than is to be found in the charter itself. <span class="sni">Its popular language.</span>
There
he spoke of the choice of the barons; in the letter to
Anselm he tells the Archbishop that his brother King
William is dead, and that he is chosen king by the will
of God and by the clergy and people of England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_894" id="fnanchor_894"></a><a href="#footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></span>
He
excuses his hasty coronation in the Archbishop’s absence
on the ground of the urgency of the time. He would
more gladly have received the blessing at his crowning
from him than from any one else; but the necessity of
the moment forbade; enemies had arisen against him
<a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pageno">365</span>
and against the people whom he had to rule; his barons
therefore and his whole people had thought that the
coronation could not be delayed. He had therefore,
against his will, received the rite from Anselm’s vicars,
and he trusted that Anselm himself would not be displeased.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_895" id="fnanchor_895"></a><a href="#footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></span>
Himself and the whole people of England,
all whose souls were entrusted to Anselm’s care, prayed
him to come back with all speed to give them the benefit
of his counsel.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_896" id="fnanchor_896"></a><a href="#footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></span>
He committed himself and the whole
people of England to the counsel of Anselm and of those
who ought to consult with Anselm for the common
good.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_897" id="fnanchor_897"></a><a href="#footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></span>
He would have sent messengers with money of
his own for Anselm’s use; only since the death of his
brother the whole world is so stirred against the kingdom
of England that he could not send any one with any
safety.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_898" id="fnanchor_898"></a><a href="#footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a></span>
Anselm is earnestly prayed not to pass through
Normandy, but to sail from Whitsand and land at Dover.
There some of the King’s barons shall be ready to meet
him with money which will enable him to pay anything
that he may have borrowed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_899" id="fnanchor_899"></a><a href="#footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></span>
The letter ends in a pious
and imploring strain; “Hasten then, father, to come,
lest our mother the church of Canterbury, so long tossed
<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pageno">366</span>
and desolate for your sake, should any longer suffer the
loss of souls.” <span class="sni">Signatures to the letter.</span>
The signatures to the letter should be
noticed. It is said to be signed by other bishops and
barons as well, but the actual names are Gerard Bishop of
Hereford, William Bishop-elect of Winchester, William of
Warelwast, of whom we have heard so often, Henry Earl
of Warwick, in some sort a milder king-maker, Robert
Fitz-hamon, and his brother Hamon the <dfn>dapifer</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_900" id="fnanchor_900"></a><a href="#footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></span>
It is
worth notice that the Achitophel of Meulan does not set
his name either to this letter or to the charter. Was it to
give as national a character as might be to both documents
that Robert, as yet only a French count and not
an English earl, abstained from putting his name to
them? One can fancy no other reason for its absence
from the earlier document. By the time the letter to
Anselm was sent, the Count of Meulan’s presence may
well have been needed in Normandy.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Dangers of the King and kingdom.</span>
The dangers which, according to King Henry’s letter,
beset the kingdom of England may have been somewhat
exaggerated in his picture of them; but they were perfectly
real. And no description of them could be better
than that which the King gave when he spoke of them
specially as dangers which beset the King and the people
whom he had to rule. <span class="sni">Intrigues of the Norman nobles with Duke Robert.</span>
It was most truly the King and the
people of England who were threatened by the intrigues
of the great Norman nobles with the restored ruler of
Normandy&mdash;&#8203;if ruler he may be called. The effects of
the Red King’s death were exactly opposite in Normandy
and in England. <span class="sni">Renewed anarchy in Normandy on William’s death.</span>
In England his reign of unright
was at once changed for a rule as strong and more
righteous. In Normandy, which had seen the better side
of him, where he had brought back peace of some kind
after the anarchy of Robert’s first reign, anarchy came
<a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pageno">367</span>
back again the moment the news of his death came.
Within a week the forces of Evreux and Conches were
again in motion, this time indeed not in order to attack
one another, but for a joint raid against the lands of the
Norman Beaumont, the possessions of the Count of
Meulan. The Count, we are told, had abused his influence
with Rufus to do both of them some wrongs, which,
while Rufus lived, they were unable to avenge.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_901" id="fnanchor_901"></a><a href="#footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a></span>
They
now took the law into their own hands; so did everybody
else. Normandy again became the same confused
field of battle, with every man’s hand against every
other man, which it had been before William the Red
at least did it the service of putting one tyrant in the
room of many.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_902" id="fnanchor_902"></a><a href="#footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Return of Robert to Normandy. September, 1100.</span>
To this disturbed land Duke Robert came back in the
month of September, bringing with him his wise and
beautiful Duchess from Conversana. They went to
Saint Michael in-Peril-of-the-Sea to give thanks for
their safe return,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_903" id="fnanchor_903"></a><a href="#footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></span>
and Robert was held to have again
taken possession of his duchy. The English Chronicler
says that he was received blithely;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_904" id="fnanchor_904"></a><a href="#footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></span>
it was certainly
not the interest of those whom a ruler like Henry would
have checked in their evil ways to make any opposition
to his fresh acknowledgement. <span class="sni">His renewed no-government.</span>
As soon as Robert was
again in his native land, all the energy and conduct which
<a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pageno">368</span>
he had shown in the East once more forsook him. The
old idleness, the old wastefulness, came back again. He
had already squandered all the money which he had received
from his father-in-law; luckily the death of Rufus
relieved him from the necessity of repaying the sum for
which the duchy had been temporarily pledged. It had
not been alienated for ever, and Henry had no claim to
it during Robert’s life. <span class="sni">Henry keeps his own fief.</span>
Robert therefore had no difficulty
in taking possession&mdash;&#8203;such possession as he could take&mdash;&#8203;of
all Normandy, except the districts which formed the
fief which Rufus had granted to Henry. There, in the
lands of Coutances, Avranches, and Bayeux, King Henry’s
men still kept the land for him, and withstood all Robert’s
attempts to dislodge them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_905" id="fnanchor_905"></a><a href="#footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a></span>
<span class="sni">War between Henry and Robert.</span>
A border warfare thus
began between the brothers almost from the first moment
of the reign of Henry, the second reign of Robert.
And it would seem that, though there was no open outbreak
till the next year, the turbulent Norman nobles
in England were, from the very beginning, <span class="sni">Intrigues of the Normans in England with Robert.</span>
making Robert
the centre of their intrigues against a prince whose rule
was eminently inconvenient for them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_906" id="fnanchor_906"></a><a href="#footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></span>
The Lion of Justice
was exactly the kind of ruler for whom they did not
wish; Robert, who would put no check upon them, was
far more to their tastes. Could they only put him on
the throne, they might have their own way in all things
in England as well as in Normandy. The same schemes
which disturbed the second year of the reign of Rufus
disturbed the reign of Henry from the very beginning.
It was in the midst of all these disorders, directly after
Robert’s return, that Henry’s letter was sent to Anselm.
<a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pageno">369</span>
It was therefore not without reason that the King warned
the Archbishop not to come back through Normandy,
but to make his way to Whitsand. <span class="sni">Return of Anselm. September 23, 1100.</span>
To Whitsand Anselm
accordingly came, and crossed safely to Dover a few days
before Michaelmas.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_907" id="fnanchor_907"></a><a href="#footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></span>
The whole land from which he had
been now nearly three years absent received him with a
burst of universal joy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_908" id="fnanchor_908"></a><a href="#footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Connexion of Anselm with Norman history.</span>
The chief points in the primacy of Anselm had all
along had a singular connexion, by way of coincidence
at least, with the changes of things in the Norman
duchy. It was when William was making ready for his
second Norman expedition that Anselm had first drawn
on himself the Red King’s anger by the alleged smallness
of his gift towards its cost.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_909" id="fnanchor_909"></a><a href="#footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a></span>
It was just before the
King set out that the Primate had given him his most
memorable rebuke.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_910" id="fnanchor_910"></a><a href="#footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a></span>
The return of William was at once
followed by the interview at Gillingham<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_911" id="fnanchor_911"></a><a href="#footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></span>
and the great
assembly at Rockingham. The collection of money for
the final occupation of the duchy did not directly lead to
the second dispute;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_912" id="fnanchor_912"></a><a href="#footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></span>
but the connexion of time is still
marked. Rufus comes back from Normandy to find fault
with Anselm’s contingent of troops for the Welsh war;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_913" id="fnanchor_913"></a><a href="#footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></span>
and he does not go again to the mainland for the French
<a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pageno">370</span>
and Cenomannian wars till after he has driven Anselm
from England. Now that the Red King is dead, everybody
seems to come back to his old place. Robert
comes back to Rouen; Anselm to Canterbury. And
along with them, a third actor in our story, whom, like
them, Rufus had dispossessed, came back also. Before
the year was out, Maine was again free; Helias had won
back city and castle without slash or blow.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Helias returns to Le Mans.</span>
As soon as the news of his enemy’s fall reached the
Count of Maine in some of those southern possessions
from which he had never been driven, he at once
gathered a force and marched to Le Mans. But no force
was needed; the loyal city received its banished prince
with all joy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_914" id="fnanchor_914"></a><a href="#footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The King’s garrison holds out in the royal tower.</span>
But possession of the city did not give
Helias possession of the royal tower; that was still held
by the garrison which had been placed in it by the Red
King. One of their commanders was a man whom we
know already, Walter of Rouen, the son of Ansgar.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_915" id="fnanchor_915"></a><a href="#footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></span>
The
castle was well provided with arms and provisions, and
all that was needed for defence. <span class="sni">Helias calls in Fulk of Anjou.</span>
Helias, before undertaking
a siege, sought the alliance and help of Fulk of
Anjou, whom he acknowledged as over-lord of Maine.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_916" id="fnanchor_916"></a><a href="#footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Siege of the tower;</span>
The two counts sat down before the castle of the
Conqueror; but no strictly warlike operations followed.
<span class="sni">courtesies between besieged and besiegers.</span>
Besieged and besiegers seem to have been on
the most friendly terms. They sometimes exchanged
threats, but more commonly jokes. It was agreed between
<a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pageno">371</span>
the two parties that Count Helias should, whenever
he chose, put on a white tunic, and should, by the
name of the White Bachelor, be received within the
tower.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_917" id="fnanchor_917"></a><a href="#footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></span>
Such was the chivalrous confidence shown on
both sides that the Count of Maine went in and out
as he chose, and much that was sportive and little
that was hostile went on between the two parties. <span class="sni">Conference between Walter and Helias.</span>
At
last Walter and his colleague Haimeric<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_918" id="fnanchor_918"></a><a href="#footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></span>
opened their
minds to Helias. They were in exactly the opposite
case to the Confessor when he told the churl that he
would hurt him if he could.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_919" id="fnanchor_919"></a><a href="#footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a></span>
They explained to their
supposed enemy that they could hurt him if they would,
but that they had no mind to do so. The ground and
the defences of the castle gave them the stronger position.
They were not afraid of his artillery, and they
could shower down stones and arrows upon him at
pleasure.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_920" id="fnanchor_920"></a><a href="#footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></span>
But they had no mind to fight against one
for whom they had a deep regard, especially as they did
not know for whom they were fighting. <span class="sni">The garrison know not whose men they are.</span>
They had been
the men of the late King William; they did not now
know whether they were the men of King Henry of
England or of Duke Robert of Normandy. They proposed
a truce, during which they might send messengers
to both their possible lords; when they got answers,
they might settle what to do.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_921" id="fnanchor_921"></a><a href="#footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></span>
<span class="sni">A truce is made; they apply to Robert,</span> The messenger came to
Robert, and asked him whether he wished to keep the
<a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a><span class="pageno">372</span>
royal tower of Le Mans or not. If he wished to keep
it, he must send a strong force to rescue it from its
Angevin and Cenomannian besiegers. The Duke, tired,
we are told, with his long journeyings and more anxious
for the repose of his bed than for the labours of war,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_922" id="fnanchor_922"></a><a href="#footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a></span>
is
made to give two somewhat contradictory reasons for
leaving matters alone. On the one hand, he was satisfied
with the duchy of Normandy; on the other hand, the
nobles of England were inviting him to come and take
the crown of that kingdom. He told them that they
had better make an honourable peace with the besiegers.
<span class="sni">and to Henry.</span>
The messenger, without going back to Le Mans, crossed
to England, and told King Henry exactly how matters
stood. Henry was too busy at the moment to meddle
in affairs beyond the sea.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_923" id="fnanchor_923"></a><a href="#footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a></span>
He rewarded the messenger,
he sent his thanks to the garrison, and left them to
their own discretion. When the answer came, a message
was sent to the White Bachelor, asking him to visit
the tower. The day was now come when he might
rejoice in the possession of that for which he had long
wished. If he had any money in his hoard, he might
now make a fine bargain. He asked what they meant.
They told him that he had not conquered them, that
they were quite able to withstand him, but that they
had no lord to serve and were quite willing to give up
the castle to him. They knew his worth and valour;
they chose him of their own free will, and made him
that day truly Count of Maine.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_924" id="fnanchor_924"></a><a href="#footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Surrender of the castle.</span>
They gave up the
<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a><span class="pageno">373</span>
castle and all that was in it; Helias of course treated
them with all honour, and gave them a strong guard to
shelter them from any attacks on the part of the citizens
whose houses they had burned the year before.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_925" id="fnanchor_925"></a><a href="#footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Last reign of Helias. 1100&ndash;1110.</span>
Thus, after all struggles, Helias of La Flèche was at last
undisputed lord of the Cenomannian city and county.
He reigned, in all honour and seemingly in perfect
friendship with Bishop Hildebert,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_926" id="fnanchor_926"></a><a href="#footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a></span>
for ten years longer.
<span class="sni">His friendship for Henry.</span>
He was the firm friend, and in some sort the vassal, of
King Henry of England, and did him good service at
Bayeux and at Tinchebrai.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_927" id="fnanchor_927"></a><a href="#footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></span>
Under his second reign
Maine seems to have been peaceful; but there must have
been some wars and fightings on its borders, as we find
Rotrou Count of Perche a prisoner in the Conqueror’s
tower.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_928" id="fnanchor_928"></a><a href="#footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His second marriage. 1109.</span>
The year before his death Helias married
a second wife, Agnes, the daughter of Duke William of
<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pageno">374</span>
Aquitaine and widow of Alfonso King of Gallicia.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_929" id="fnanchor_929"></a><a href="#footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></span>
But
his only child was Eremberga, the daughter of his first
wife Matilda of Château du Loir. Helias, as he was the
worthiest, was also the last, of the counts who held
Maine as a separate sovereignty, and who had for some
generations filled no small place in their own quarter of
the world. <span class="sni">Later fortune of Maine.</span>
Maine became the heritage of his daughter,
and passed to her husband the younger Fulk, Count of
Anjou and King of Jerusalem,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_930" id="fnanchor_930"></a><a href="#footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a></span>
and to her son Geoffrey
Plantagenet. Thus Maine became an appendage to Anjou,
to Normandy, to England. <span class="sni">Descent of the Angevin kings from Helias.</span>
And every sovereign of
England, from the first Angevin king onwards, could
boast that he had in his veins, besides the blood of
William and Cerdic, the blood, less famous it may be,
but assuredly not less worthy, of Helias of Le Mans.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Meeting of Anselm and Henry; beginning of fresh difficulties. Changes in Anselm.</span>
Anselm landed in England after Helias had been received
at Le Mans, but before he had won back the royal tower.
The King and the Primate soon met, and difficulties
at once arose between them. The truth is that
Anselm had come back, in some things, another man.
Or rather the man was the same; his gentleness, his
firmness, his perfect single-mindedness, had not changed
a whit. But he had learned doctrines at Rome and at
Bari which had never been revealed to him at Bec or at
Canterbury. <span class="sni">Comparison of the dispute between Anselm</span>
The tale of Anselm’s dispute with Henry,
his second banishment, his second return, goes beyond
the prescribed limits of our story, and I have pointed
<a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pageno">375</span>
out its leading features elsewhere.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_931" id="fnanchor_931"></a><a href="#footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a></span>
<span class="sni">and Rufus and the dispute between Anselm and Henry.</span>
There is hardly
anything in which the difference between William Rufus
and Henry the First stands out more strongly. But we
are here concerned only with the very earliest stage of
the dispute, if indeed it is to be called a stage of the dispute
at all. Henry and Anselm met at Salisbury. The
King received the Archbishop with joy; he again excused
himself by the necessities of the time for having received
the royal unction from another prelate. Anselm fully
admitted his excuses.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_932" id="fnanchor_932"></a><a href="#footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a></span>
There was less agreement between
them on the next point which the King started.
<span class="sni">Henry calls on Anselm to do homage.</span>
Henry called on Anselm to do homage to him after the
manner of his predecessors, and, in the language of the
time, to receive again the archbishopric at his hands.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_933" id="fnanchor_933"></a><a href="#footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Phrase of receiving the archbishopric.</span>
This last phrase has, I think, sometimes been misunderstood.
It has nothing in common with the fresh
commissions which the bishops of Edward the Sixth’s
day took out after the death of Henry the Eighth. It
has nothing whatever to do with the spiritual office; in
this phrase, as in so many others, by the “archbishopric”
is to be understood simply the temporalities of the see.
These were at this moment in the King’s hands through
their seizure in the days of Rufus. Since then a new
reign had begun; England had a new king; her inhabitants
had a new lord; for the archbishop, like any
other subject, to become the man of the new king was
simply according to the law of Salisbury. For him to
receive back his lands was his right; for him to receive
them as a fief was no more than he had already done at
the hands of the Red King. Anselm had then done
<a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pageno">376</span>
without scruple all that he was now asked to do. <span class="sni">Effect of the new teaching on Anselm’s mind.</span>
But
since then the decrees of Piacenza and Clermont, above
all the decrees of Bari and Rome, where he had been himself
present, had been put forth. And by those decrees
the ancient customs of England were condemned, and the
censures of the Church were denounced against all who
should conform to them. Anselm deemed it his duty,
in all single-mindedness, to obey the bidding of Rome
rather than the law of England. We may regret, but
we can neither wonder nor blame. Anselm, after all,
was not an Englishman; he could not help looking at
things with œcumenical rather than with insular eyes.
He fairly told the king’s counsellors how matters stood;
he was bound by the new decrees. If Henry would accept
them, there might be perfect peace between them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_934" id="fnanchor_934"></a><a href="#footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></span>
If not,
he himself could be of no use in England; he would
have to refuse to communicate with any to whom the
King might give bishoprics or abbeys in the ancient
fashion; he could not stay in England on the terms of disobeying
the Pope. He asked of those to whom he spoke
that the King would consider the matter, and tell him his
decision, that he might know which way to turn himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_935" id="fnanchor_935"></a><a href="#footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Difficulties of Henry.</span>
Henry was now, at the very beginning of his reign, in
a great strait. He was naturally unwilling to give up
one of the chief flowers of his crown, one which had
been handed down from all the kings before him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_936" id="fnanchor_936"></a><a href="#footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a></span>
To
<a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pageno">377</span>
give up the investiture of the churches and the homage
of their prelates would be to give up the half of his
kingdom. On the other hand, he felt that it would not
do to quarrel with the Archbishop at the very moment of
his return to England, or to allow him to leave England
while he himself was not yet firm on his throne. He
feared&mdash;&#8203;doing Anselm, we may be sure, utter injustice&mdash;&#8203;that,
if Anselm left England, he might go to Robert,
and take up his cause. It would be perfectly easy, as
he knew very well, to persuade Robert to accept the
new decrees. And on those terms, Anselm might, so the
words run, make Robert King of England<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_937" id="fnanchor_937"></a><a href="#footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;that is, he
might bestow on him a consecration more regular than
that which Henry had himself received from the Bishop
of London. <span class="sni">A truce made till Easter; the Pope to be asked to allow the homage.</span>
It was therefore agreed on both sides to
make a truce or adjournment of all questions till the
next Easter. Meanwhile both King and Archbishop
should send messengers to the Pope, to pray him so to
change his decrees as to allow the ancient customs of
the kingdom to stand.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_938" id="fnanchor_938"></a><a href="#footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></span>
<span class="sni">No personal scruple on Anselm’s part.</span>
We here see, on the one hand,
that Anselm still had no kind of scruple of his own
about the homage and investiture; it was with him
simply a question of obedience to a superior. Let
Paschal withdraw the decrees of Urban, and Anselm
was perfectly ready to do by Henry as earlier archbishops
had done by earlier kings. <span class="sni">Effects of the reign of Rufus.</span>
On the other hand,
we see how the temporal power had been weakened
<a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a><span class="pageno">378</span>
and the spiritual power strengthened through the
late King’s abuse of the temporal power. Rufus had
given the foreign dominion a moral advantage, of which
Henry now felt the sting. Men had come to look on
the King as the embodiment of wrong, and on the Pope
as the only surviving embodiment of right. <span class="sni">Abasement of the kingly power.</span>
The King
of the English was driven to ask the Bishop of Rome to
allow the ancient laws of England to be obeyed. True
this was while the King’s hold on his crown was still
weak; when his position was more assured, he took a
higher tone; but it marks the change which had happened
that an English king, and such a king as Henry, should
be driven so to abase himself even for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The truce agreed to; provisional restoration of the Archbishop’s temporalities.</span>
By the terms of the truce, things were to remain as
they were for the present. Anselm was to be restored
to his temporalities without homage or other conditions;
but, if Paschal could not be brought to yield on the
matter of the decrees, they were to pass to the King
again.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_939" id="fnanchor_939"></a><a href="#footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a></span>
Anselm looked on all this as useless; he knew
the temper of the papal court better than the King and
his friends did. But he agreed for the sake of peace;
he wished to avoid the slightest suspicion of any wish
to disturb the King in the possession of his kingdom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_940" id="fnanchor_940"></a><a href="#footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></span>
The truce was therefore agreed to; the messengers were
sent, and Anselm, when the court broke up, went once
more in peace to his metropolitan city or to some other
of his many houses.</p>

<p class="p2">But, besides settling the affairs of his Church and
<a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pageno">379</span>
realm, Henry had other more distinctly domestic and
personal duties to discharge. <span class="sni">Reformation of the court.</span>
He had to reform the
household which he had inherited from his brother; he
had also&mdash;&#8203;so we are told that the bishops and others
strongly pressed upon him&mdash;&#8203;to reform his own life.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_941" id="fnanchor_941"></a><a href="#footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Personal character of Henry.</span>
The vices of Henry were at least not the vices of
Rufus; inclination as well as duty led him to cleanse

of the works of darkness.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_942" id="fnanchor_942"></a><a href="#footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a></span>
But it was only in a wholly

have been hailed as a moral reformer. <span class="sni">Henry’s mistresses and children.</span> His private life

the other, who afterwards, like

<span class="sni">Henry’s daughter by Isabel of Meulan.</span>
His birth
therefore most likely came long after the times of which
we are speaking, as did the birth of the daughter whom
Henry is said to have had by a woman of a Norman
house of the loftiest rank, Isabel, daughter of his chief
counsellor, Robert Count of Meulan and Earl of Leicester.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_947" id="fnanchor_947"></a><a href="#footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Richard son of Ansfrida.</span>
The list of Henry’s natural children is not yet
exhausted&mdash;&#8203;we have no account of the mother of the
valiant Juliana; but the birth of one who is second in
personal fame to Earl Robert of Gloucester had already
taken place, and it is connected with a characteristic
story which is worth telling. <span class="sni">Story of his mother and her husband Anskill.</span>
A wealthy man of Berkshire,
Anskill by name, was one of the chief tenants
of the church of Abingdon. As far as his name is
concerned, he might be Norman; he might be English
or rather Danish. His enemies brought a charge against
him to the Red King, who caused him to be kept in
so sharp a prison that before long he died of his hardships.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_948" id="fnanchor_948"></a><a href="#footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a></span>
He left a widow, whose name is given as Ansfrida,
and a son named William. The King then seized
on the manor of Sparsholt, which Anskill had held of
the abbey, and gave it&mdash;&#8203;or perhaps only its wardship&mdash;&#8203;to
one of his officers named Toustain, without reserving
any service to the Church.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_949" id="fnanchor_949"></a><a href="#footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></span>
By this grant both
<a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a><span class="pageno">381</span>
the young William and the church of Abingdon were
wronged. For the wardship of its tenant would even,
by Flambard’s own law, go to the abbey. The widow,
by what instinct we are not told, betook herself to
Henry to ask his intercession with his brother the
King. Young William did not get back his land,
which was recovered for the abbey at a later time.
<span class="sni">Henry’s son Richard.</span>
But his mother presently gave him a half-brother,
Richard, who afterwards distinguished himself in the
French wars, and died in the White Ship.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_950" id="fnanchor_950"></a><a href="#footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></span>
The interest
of Henry, if it did not get back Sparsholt for its
lawful tenant, was enough to secure for his new mistress
the safe possession of her dower, and to provide for her
legitimate son by an advantageous marriage.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_951" id="fnanchor_951"></a><a href="#footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a></span>
Ansfrida
<a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a><span class="pageno">382</span>
herself was in the end buried in the minster of Abingdon
with honours of which Saint Hugh would hardly have
approved, and her lawful son did not fail to give gifts to
the place of his mother’s burial.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_952" id="fnanchor_952"></a><a href="#footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Henry is exhorted to marry.</span>
Henry then, if he was fully entitled to reform the
worst abuses of his brother’s household, stood in some
need of reformation himself. His counsellors exhorted
him to mend matters by giving himself a wife and his
kingdom a queen. He had not far to look for one when
policy and inclination led him the same way. <span class="sni">He seeks for Eadgyth daughter of Malcolm.</span>
Notwithstanding
all his irregularities, we are told that he had
long loved Eadgyth or Matilda, the daughter of Malcolm,
and it is further implied that his love was returned
on her part.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_953" id="fnanchor_953"></a><a href="#footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a></span>
It is not clear where she was at

Christina in her monastic shelter at Romsey.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_954" id="fnanchor_954"></a><a href="#footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></span>
She was
now about twenty years old, some say of remarkable

an amount of learning which must have equalled or
exceeded that of her clerkly lover.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_955" id="fnanchor_955"></a><a href="#footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a></span>

<span class="sni">Policy of the marriage.</span>
but she came of a stock which
made a marriage with her the most politic choice which
the King could make at the moment. <span class="sni">Eadgyth looked on as English.</span>
Eadgyth had
lived so long in England that men seem to have forgotten
that she was the daughter of Malcolm, and to
have remembered only that she was the daughter of
Margaret. As such she was held to be of the right
kingly kin of England,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_957" id="fnanchor_957"></a><a href="#footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a></span>
marked out as the most fitting
bride for a king whose purpose was to reign as an
Englishman. True she came of the blood of Cerdic only
by the spindle-side, and by the spindle-side Henry came
of the blood of Cerdic himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_958" id="fnanchor_958"></a><a href="#footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Henry’s descent from Ælfred.</span>
But no one was likely
to remember that a daughter of Ælfred was a remote
ancestress of Henry’s mother, while everybody remembered
that Eadgyth was the daughter of Margaret, the
daughter of Eadward, the son of Eadmund, the son of
Æthelred, the son of Eadgar. It was for the English
King to take an English Lady, and to hand on the English
crown to kings born in the land and sprung of the
true blood of its ancient princes.</p>

<p>So thought the people; so thought the King; so
<a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a><span class="pageno">384</span>
seemingly thought the daughter of Malcolm herself.
<span class="sni">Objections made to the marriage.</span>
But not a few mouths were opened to denounce the
marriage as contrary to the laws of the Church. Eadgyth,
they alleged, was a consecrated virgin, and a marriage
with her would be sacrilege. <span class="sni">Eadgyth said to have taken the veil.</span>
She had, they said,
taken the veil at Romsey, when she was dwelling there
with her aunt Christina.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_959" id="fnanchor_959"></a><a href="#footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a></span>
She appealed to the Archbishop,
to whom all looked to decide the matter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_960" id="fnanchor_960"></a><a href="#footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a></span>
She
told her story, as we have already heard it, and called
on Anselm to judge her cause in his wisdom. <span class="sni">Anselm holds an assembly to settle the question.</span>
The
Archbishop called together at Lambeth&mdash;&#8203;the manor of
his friend the Bishop of Rochester&mdash;&#8203;an assembly of
bishops, abbots, nobles, and religious men, before whom
he laid the matter, and the evidence bearing on it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_961" id="fnanchor_961"></a><a href="#footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></span>
There was the evidence of the maiden herself; there was
the evidence of two archdeacons, William of Canterbury
and Humbald of Salisbury, whom Anselm had sent to
the monastery, and who, after inquiries among the
sisters, reported that there was no ground to think that
Eadgyth had ever been a veiled nun.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_962" id="fnanchor_962"></a><a href="#footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a></span>
The Archbishop
then left the assembly, and the rest, who are spoken of
as the Church of England gathered into one place,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_963" id="fnanchor_963"></a><a href="#footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a></span>
debated the question in his absence. Much stress was
laid on the case of those women who, in the first days of
the Conquest, had sought shelter in the cloister from
<a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a><span class="pageno">385</span>
shame and violence, but who had not taken religion
upon themselves.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_964" id="fnanchor_964"></a><a href="#footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Eadgyth declared free to marry.</span>
The late Archbishop had declared
them free to marry, and the judgement of the assembly

the daughter of Malcolm.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_965" id="fnanchor_965"></a><a href="#footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a></span>
Anselm came back, and the
debate and the decision were reported to him. He declared
that he assented to the judgement, strengthened
as it was by the great authority of Lanfranc.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_966" id="fnanchor_966"></a><a href="#footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></span>
Then
Eadgyth herself was brought in, and heard with a
pleased countenance all that had passed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_967" id="fnanchor_967"></a><a href="#footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a></span>
She then
offered to confirm all that she had said by any form of
oath that might be thought good. She did not fear that
any one would disbelieve her; but she wished that no
occasion should be left for any one to blaspheme.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_968" id="fnanchor_968"></a><a href="#footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></span>
Anselm told her that no oath was needed; if any man
out of the evil treasure of his heart should bring forth
evil things, he would not be able to withstand the
amount and strength of the evidence by which her case
was proved.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_969" id="fnanchor_969"></a><a href="#footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a></span>
He gave her his blessing,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_970" id="fnanchor_970"></a><a href="#footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a></span>
and she went

<p><span class="sni">Other versions of the story.</span>
In another version, also contemporary but not resting
on the same high authority, things are made to take
<a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a><span class="pageno">386</span>
another turn. The King bids Anselm perform the marriage
rite between himself and the nameless daughter of

<span class="sni">Anselm made to object.</span>
Anselm refuses
on the ground that, having worn the veil of a nun, she
belonged to a heavenly, not to an earthly bridegroom.
The King says that he has sworn to her father to marry
her, and that he cannot break his oath, unless it can be
shown by a canonical judgement that the marriage is
unlawful.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_972" id="fnanchor_972"></a><a href="#footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></span>

The King bids Anselm call on the

The assembled fathers debate;
canons are read, and it is judged that the maiden is free

consent.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_975" id="fnanchor_975"></a><a href="#footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Anselm’s scruples and warning.</span>
The King asks Anselm whether he objects to
this decision; Anselm says that he has no fault to find
with it. Henry then asks Anselm to marry them at
<a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a><span class="pageno">387</span>
once. Anselm pleads that, though the judgement is right,
yet, as the maiden had somehow or other worn the veil,
it were better that she should not marry; there were
others, daughters of kings and counts, one of whom the
King might marry instead. Henry still insists; Anselm
performs the ceremony; but with a warning that England
would not rejoice in the offspring of the marriage.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_976" id="fnanchor_976"></a><a href="#footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a></span>
The fate of the White Ship and the wars of Stephen and
Matilda are quoted as a proof of Anselm’s prophetic power.</p>

<p>The tone of this story is quite unlike that of the more
trustworthy version; yet there is perhaps no actual
contradiction between them. But the foreign writer
stumbles greatly in his names and pedigrees, and writes
by the light of forty years later. <span class="sni">Later fables.</span>
We may see in his

<p><span class="sni">Marriage of Henry and Eadgyth. November 11, 1100. She takes the name of Matilda.</span>
A few days later, on the feast of Saint Martin, the

It is only
<a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a><span class="pageno">388</span>
a guess that this was the time of her change of name.
One hardly sees its motive; it was Henry’s policy at
this moment to be as English as possible, and the name
of his bride was one of the few English names which the
Normans now and then adopted. Could it be Henry’s
abiding reverence for his mother which made him wish
to place another Matilda on his throne? Be this as it
may be, the new Queen bears no other name. <span class="sni">The wedding and coronation.</span>
All the

on high and harangued the people. <span class="sni">Anselm’s speech.</span>

The rite was done. <span class="sni">Objections not wholly silenced.</span>
But
there were still some who blamed Anselm for the course
that he had taken;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_981" id="fnanchor_981"></a><a href="#footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></span>
and years afterwards the validity
of Matilda’s marriage, and the consequent legitimacy of
her children, was called in question by those whose
political objects it suited to do so.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_982" id="fnanchor_982"></a><a href="#footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></span></p>

<p>It is somewhat singular that Matilda practically
stepped into the place of the Lady whose name she
had forsaken. There had been no queen constantly
living in England since the elder Eadgyth. The
elder Matilda had been but little in England; William
Rufus had been pre-eminently the “bachelor king.”

It must have been a wonderful change when the riot
and foul excess of the Red King’s court gave way
to a household presided over by a devout and virtuous
woman. <span class="sni">Regular life of the King and Queen.</span>
For a time at least Henry as well as his
wife lived a sober and regular life. As a generation
back the strict conduct of Henry’s father had called
forth the jeers of the profligate scoffers of his day, so
now the profligate scoffers of another generation jeered
at the decorous court of Henry and Matilda, <span class="sni">“Godric and Godgifu.”</span>
and
mocked the English King and his English Lady by the
characteristic English names of Godric and Godgifu.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_983" id="fnanchor_983"></a><a href="#footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a></span>
<span class="sni">1100&ndash;1118.</span>
The married life of Matilda reached over eighteen years
only; <span class="sni">Children of the marriage. William;</span>

she did not live to see her son, the Ætheling

After a while Henry seems to have fallen
back into his old courses; <span class="sni">Later life of Henry and Matilda.</span> some at least of his natural
children must have been born after his marriage; and
the same kind of language which was used about his

The Queen,
for whatever reason, ceased to follow the endless wanderings

Westminster.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_986" id="fnanchor_986"></a><a href="#footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Her character.</span>
Her piety rivalled that of her mother;
it was shown in all the usual forms of the time; and
her brother David, not an undevout prince, went so near
to a scoff as to ask his sister whether King Henry would
care to kiss the lips which had kissed the ulcers of the
lepers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_987" id="fnanchor_987"></a><a href="#footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a></span>
Her boundless liberality to the poor, to clerks,

the less amiable for a manifest touch of vanity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_988" id="fnanchor_988"></a><a href="#footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a></span>
We
read that the means for her lavish bounty in this way
had to be found by harsh exactions from her tenants;
but, here as ever, the blame is laid upon the reeves
rather than on their mistress.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_989" id="fnanchor_989"></a><a href="#footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></span>
<span class="sni">“Good Queen Mold.”</span>
The memory of “good
<a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a><span class="pageno">391</span>
Queen Mold” was long cherished, and we can hardly
doubt that her presence by Henry’s side did much to
help the fusion of Normans and English in her husband’s
kingdom.</p>

<p class="p2">Two ecclesiastical events wind up the last year of the
eleventh century. <span class="sni">Guy of Vienne comes as Legate.</span>
One of them showed that there were
limits to Anselm’s submission to the see of Rome. Guy
Archbishop of Vienne came into England, professing to
be papal Legate throughout all Britain. Legates had
been seen in England before, but not with such a commission
as superseded the authority of an acknowledged
Primate. <span class="sni">Earlier Legates.</span> They had come both under Eadward and
under William the Great; but they came in the doubtful
days of Stigand, and the last time they came to set
Stigand finally aside.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_990" id="fnanchor_990"></a><a href="#footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></span>

William the Red; but it was to bring the pallium to
Anselm.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_991" id="fnanchor_991"></a><a href="#footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Guy’s pretensions not acknowledged.</span>

been held to belong to none but the Patriarch of the
island world.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_992" id="fnanchor_992"></a><a href="#footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></span>

this time Guy went back as he came.

him as Legate, and that he was not able to discharge
any legatine function.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_994" id="fnanchor_994"></a><a href="#footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Death of Archbishop Thomas. November 18, 1100.</span>
The other event was the death of Archbishop Thomas
of York, after an episcopate of thirty years. He died a
few days after the King’s marriage, leaving a good name
<a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a><span class="pageno">392</span>
behind him as the honoured rebuilder of his church and
legislator of its chapter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_995" id="fnanchor_995"></a><a href="#footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></span>
This was the first prelacy
which had fallen vacant since Henry’s accession. To
deal with the vacant see after his brother’s fashion
would have been in the teeth of all the new King’s promises.
He therefore soon gave the church of York
another shepherd. But his choice fell on a man of a
character widely different from either Thomas or Anselm.
The new archbishop was Gerard Bishop of Hereford,
of whom we have already heard a good deal, and
heard some things that are passing strange.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_996" id="fnanchor_996"></a><a href="#footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></span>

<p class="p2 center">§ 3. <span class="title">The Invasion of Robert.</span><br />
<i>January-August, 1101.</i></p>

<p><span class="sni">Likeness of the years 1088 and 1101.</span>
The first year of the twelfth century was a stirring
time for England, though it was not crowded with great
and striking events like the last year of the eleventh.
It reads like an earlier chapter of our story coming over
again. We have now again to tell well nigh the same
tale which we told at the beginning of the reign of
Rufus. Again we have a Norman rebellion on English
soil; again we have a Norman invasion; again the
<a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a><span class="pageno">393</span>
English people cleave steadily to the king whom they
have chosen; again the Primate and the bishops in
general take the side which was at once the side of the
King and of the people. <span class="sni">Action of the Bishop of Durham,</span> And, as if to make the likeness
square in the smallest details, a bishop set free from
bonds is the foremost stirrer up of mischief, and again
three sons of Earl Roger are the most active leaders of
the revolt. <span class="sni">of the sons of Earl Roger.</span> The part of Bishop Odo of Bayeux in the
former rebellion is in the present played to some extent
by Bishop Randolf of Durham; the part of Robert of
Bellême is played again in more than all its fulness by
Robert of Bellême himself. <span class="sni">Plots to give the crown to Duke Robert.</span>
There is again a party
eager to place the Duke of the Normans on the throne
of England; but this time that party is balanced by
another which in the other tale does not appear till
later, <span class="sni">A party in Normandy for Henry.</span>
a party eager to place the King of the English in
the ducal chair of Normandy.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Character of Robert and Eadgar.</span>
Robert, like his chosen companion Eadgar, could play
an active and honourable part anywhere save in his
own country. Both alike show to far greater advantage
in Palestine and in Scotland than in Normandy or
in England. The seeming inconsistency is not hard
to understand. Neither of them perhaps lacked mere
capacity&mdash;&#8203;Robert certainly did not. And Robert most
certainly did not lack generous feeling. But both lacked
that moral strength without which mere feeling and
mere capacity can do very little. Such men can act
well and vigorously now and then, by fits and starts,
when some special motive is brought to bear upon
them. They can act better on behalf of others than
they can on behalf of themselves, because, when they
act for others, a special motive is brought to bear upon
them. Their own cause they may, if they like, neglect
or betray&mdash;&#8203;forgetting that, when a prince betrays his
own cause, he commonly betrays the cause of many
<a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a><span class="pageno">394</span>
others; but it is a point of honour not to betray or to
neglect the cause of another which is entrusted to them.
Thus it was that both Robert and Eadgar, who could do
nothing for themselves, could do a good deal for others,
whether as counsellors, as negotiators, or as military
commanders. <span class="sni">Robert as crusader.</span>
The crusade had brought out all Robert’s
best qualities; but we have seen that, even on the crusade,
he had yielded to any great and sudden temptation.
Amidst so many noble and valiant comrades,
he could not shrink from the siege or the battle; and,
once brought up to the siege or the battle, he showed
himself, not only a daring soldier, but a skilful captain.
But at Laodikeia he had been the same man that he was
at Rouen. <span class="sni">His relapse on his return to Normandy.</span>
Now that he was again at Rouen, Antioch
and Jerusalem passed away; it was all Laodikeia with
him. The dream of winning the English crown floated
before his eyes, and at last stirred him up to action.
<span class="sni">His renewed misgovernment.</span>
Otherwise he sank into his old listlessness, his old
lavishness, his old vices and follies of every kind. It
may be an overdrawn picture which paints him as
lying in bed till noon, and neglecting to attend mass,
because he had no clothes to go in; the base persons of
both sexes who surrounded him had carried them all off.
Some odd chance that happened once must have been
spoken of as a habit.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_998" id="fnanchor_998"></a><a href="#footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a></span>
But there is no ground for
doubting the general description of Robert’s misgovernment
or rather no-government, both before he went to
the crusade and after he came back from it.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Parties in England and Normandy.</span>
It may at first sight seem a paradox that there
should be at the same moment a party in Normandy
anxious to hand over the duchy to Henry and a party
<a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a><span class="pageno">395</span>
in England anxious to hand over the kingdom to Robert.
But quiet men in Normandy, who wished their country to
enjoy some peace, would naturally wish to place it under
the rule of Henry, while the kind of men who, at the
accession of Rufus, had wished to bring Robert into England
would equally wish to bring him now. <span class="sni">Henry’s strict rule distasteful to the Norman nobles.</span>
They had
perhaps already found out that where Henry reigned
none might misdo with other, and to misdo with other
was to a large part of the Norman nobles the very
business of life.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Their plots against him.</span>
The greater part of those nobles were now beginning
to plot against the King. The estates which most of
them held in Normandy gave them special opportunities
for so doing, by giving them excuses for going to and
fro between England and Normandy. <span class="sni">Robert of Bellême and his brothers.</span> Of this they
were not slow to take advantage. The three sons of
Earl Roger of Shrewsbury, Robert of Bellême and his
brothers Arnulf and Roger, were busy in this work;
<span class="sni">Robert of Pontefract. Ivo of Grantmesnil.</span>
so was Robert the son of Ilbert of Lacy, beginning
to be known as Robert of Pontefract; so was Ivo of
Grantmesnil, son of the deceased Sheriff of Leicestershire,
himself best known as the rope-dancer of Antioch.
<span class="sni">Earl Walter.</span>
And we are somewhat surprised to find on
the same list, now at the very end of his long life, the
aged Walter Giffard, lord of Longueville and Earl of
Buckingham. All these were in secret communication
with the Duke.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_999" id="fnanchor_999"></a><a href="#footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></span>
But none of them, Robert of Bellême
least of all, was inclined to serve the Duke or any
other lord for naught. <span class="sni">Duke Robert’s grants to Robert of Bellême.</span>
Duke Robert distributed castles
and lands among them, and promised to give them
greater gifts still when he should be king of England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1000" id="fnanchor_1000"></a><a href="#footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a></span>
To Robert of Bellême he granted the forest of Gouffers,
<a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a><span class="pageno">396</span>
and the castle of Argentan of whose siege we heard
seven years before;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1001" id="fnanchor_1001"></a><a href="#footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a></span>
he further confirmed him in a
claim very dear to the house of Bellême, by granting
<a name="line396_4" id="line396_4"></a>him the ducal right of advowson over the bishopric of
Seez.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1002" id="fnanchor_1002"></a><a href="#footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a></span>
<span class="sni">He gives back Gisors to Pagan.</span>
And, strangest of all, the Duke gave back the
fortress of Gisors, the bulwark of his duchy, to its former
holder Theobald or Pagan, because he had once hospitably
entertained him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1003" id="fnanchor_1003"></a><a href="#footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></span>
Did not Robert of Bellême ask
that, if his own master-piece of engineering was to pass
out of the hands of the prince, it should pass into no
hands but his own? Thus Duke Robert’s way of making
ready for the conquest of England was to squander the
resources of Normandy. Every inch of his territory,
every stone of his fortresses, stood ready to be granted
away, almost to any one who would take the trouble
to ask for them.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Christmas Gemót at Westminster. 1100&ndash;1101.</span>
Things were thus brewing through the winter without
any open outbreak. At Christmas King Henry wore his
crown at Westminster.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1004" id="fnanchor_1004"></a><a href="#footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a></span>
That was a better place than
Gloucester for watching movements beyond the sea.
And soon after the feast and assembly the cause of
Robert was strengthened by an unexpected helper,
whose coming seems to have put a new life into his
supporters. <span class="sni">Escape of the Bishop of Durham.</span>
The Bishop of Durham, Randolf Flambard,
suddenly showed himself in his native land of
<a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a><span class="pageno">397</span>
Normandy. We saw him but lately shut up, to the joy
of all men, in the Conqueror’s Tower. His keeper,
William of Mandeville, may have been negligent; at
all events his captivity was easy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1005" id="fnanchor_1005"></a><a href="#footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></span>
The King clearly
did not mean it to be harsh, as he allowed him two
shillings a day for his keep. Flambard, with all his
sins, was a pleasant and liberal companion, and he kept
many friends, even in his fall.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1006" id="fnanchor_1006"></a><a href="#footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></span>
He was allowed the
company of those friends; with them he made merry in
his prison, and gave costly banquets to them and to his
keepers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1007" id="fnanchor_1007"></a><a href="#footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></span>
At last the means of escape were given to
him; a rope was brought hidden in a vessel of water or
wine. The Bishop made a feast for his keepers, and
plied them well with the wine. When they were snoring
in their drunken sleep, Flambard tied his rope to the
small column which divided one of the double windows
usual in the architecture of his day.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1008" id="fnanchor_1008"></a><a href="#footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a></span>
Even at such a
moment, he did not forget that he was now a bishop;
<a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a><span class="pageno">398</span>
he took his pastoral staff with him, and began to let
himself down by the rope. But he had forgotten another,
and at that moment a more useful, part of the
episcopal dress. He left his gloves behind; so his hands
suffered sadly in his descent. Moreover the Bishop was
a bulky man and his rope was too short; so he fell with
a heavy fall, and lay groaning and half dead.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1009" id="fnanchor_1009"></a><a href="#footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a></span>
But his
friends and followers were at the foot of the Tower
ready to help him. How they came there it is not
easy to see, unless there was treason in the fortress;
they should surely have been kept out by the wall with
which Rufus, at such cost to his people, had surrounded
his father’s Tower.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1010" id="fnanchor_1010"></a><a href="#footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a></span>
So however the tale is told. The
Bishop’s faithful helpers had got good horses ready and
his treasure all safe. They set sail for Normandy; Flambard
went in one ship, his witch mother with the treasure
in another. <span class="sni">Adventures of his mother.</span>
This second vessel was seized by pirates and
the treasure carried off; the old woman and the crew

<span class="sni">His reception by Duke Robert; he stirs him up against Henry.</span>
Flambard made
his way to the court of Duke Robert, became his chief
counsellor, and worked hard to stir him up by every

Meanwhile King Henry held the Easter feast at Winchester.
<span class="sni">The questions between the King and Anselm adjourned.</span>
The only recorded business of the meeting is

had not come back, the matters in dispute between

return.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1013" id="fnanchor_1013"></a><a href="#footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></span>
But meanwhile most of the chief men of Norman

the Chronicler says, plotting with the Duke against the
King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1014" id="fnanchor_1014"></a><a href="#footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Growth of the conspiracy.</span>

his brother, the refusal made another traitor.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1015" id="fnanchor_1015"></a><a href="#footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a></span>
Instead
of a list of the conspirators, we get a list of the few
who remained faithful. <span class="sni">The few faithful.</span>
These were the two Beaumont
brothers, Roger Bigod, Henry’s old friend Richard of
Redvers, and the lord of Gloucester and Glamorgan,
Robert Fitz-Hamon.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1016" id="fnanchor_1016"></a><a href="#footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a></span>
To these we ought surely to add
old Earl Hugh; but he was drawing near to the end of
his days. The rest sent secret messages to Robert, and
mocked openly at Godric and Godgifu. It would seem
however that there was as yet no open rebellion on
English ground.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Whitsun Gemót. June 9, 1101. Popular character of the assembly.</span>
The King next kept the Whitsun feast; the place is
not mentioned, but it was doubtless Westminster; and
the malecontents do not seem to have followed the old
tactics of refusing to appear in the assembly. This
Pentecostal gathering is spoken of as a vast assemblage
both of the nobles and of the people in general.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1017" id="fnanchor_1017"></a><a href="#footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></span>
In an
<a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span class="pageno">400</span>
assembly held close to London the popular element
would, as in the days of Stephen, be better able to make
itself felt than at Winchester and Gloucester. <span class="sni">Advice of Robert of Meulan.</span>
And it
was on the popular element that the King relied. We
are told that his subtle counsellor from Meulan taught
him that, at such a moment as this, he must be lavish of
promises, even to the length of promising London or
York, if they should be asked for.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1018" id="fnanchor_1018"></a><a href="#footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a></span>

again.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1019" id="fnanchor_1019"></a><a href="#footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a></span>
In the assembly, King and nobles met with
mutual suspicions. <span class="sni">Mediation of Anselm.</span>
The common voice of all ranks put
Anselm forward as the mediator between the nation and
its sovereign. It was indeed his constitutional place, a
place which in the late reign Anselm had never been
able to fill, but in which he was now called on to act, and
in which he acted honourably and vigorously. <span class="sni">Renewed promise of good laws.</span>
A second
promise of good laws was the result.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1020" id="fnanchor_1020"></a><a href="#footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a></span>
Parties were now
<a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a><span class="pageno">401</span>
divided very much as they had been at the beginning of
the reign of Rufus.
Anselm played the part of Lanfranc; <span class="sni">The Church and the people for Henry.</span>
the bishops were all loyal; the English people clave unswervingly
to the king of their own choice, the king
born on their own soil, the king who could speak to the
hearts of Englishmen in the English tongue. They, we
are emphatically told, knew nothing of the rights of any
other prince.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1021" id="fnanchor_1021"></a><a href="#footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></span>
They were for the English king, son of a
king; they had no part or lot in the foreign duke, son of
a duke. And it is implied that, not only the English by
descent, but that men of all classes and all races, except
the few great men who had a vested interest in anarchy,
were with one consent steady in their loyalty to the
King and ready to fight for him against any invader.
<span class="sni">England united against Norman invasion.</span>
There was again an united nation, a nation perhaps
more united than it had been five-and-thirty years
before, ready to withstand the new, the last attempt, at
a Norman conquest of England. If a few earls and
great lords played a game of yet more active treason
than had been played by Eadwine and Morkere, they
were not able, as Eadwine and Morkere had been able,
to keep back any part of the force of England from
joining the national standard.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Importance of the campaign of 1101.</span>
The campaign which now followed, if campaign is the
right word when armies merely look at one another
without fighting, marks an important stage in the process
which it was the work of Henry’s reign finally to
carry out, <span class="sni">Fusion of Normans and English under Henry. Last opposition of Normans and English.</span>
the fusion of Normans and English in England.
The siege of Rochester was the last time when
<a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a><span class="pageno">402</span>
Normans and Englishmen, by those names, met in arms
as enemies on English ground. Now, at Pevensey and
at Portsmouth, we for the last time hear of Englishmen
on English ground spoken of in such a way as to imply
that there were other dwellers in England who were not
English. In the first year of Henry such language was
still true; to go no further, the chief counsellor of the
King was the man who had been the first to break down
the English barricade on Senlac. Long before the last
year of Henry, the men who had fought on Senlac on either
side had passed away; the sons and grandsons of the
conquerors had put on the nationality of the conquered.
<span class="sni">Warfare of 1102.</span>
The struggle which did not come to blows this year did
come to blows in the next; the fighting which was
found not to be needed against Robert of Normandy
was found to be needed against Robert of Bellême. <span class="sni">Peace of King Henry. 1102&ndash;1135.</span>
Then for thirty-three years there was peace in the island,
though there was often war on the mainland. Englishmen
believed that the old score was wiped out when they won
Normandy for an English king; and the belief, if partly a
delusion, was not wholly so. <span class="sni">English feeling about Tinchebrai. 1106.</span> On English ground the
distinction of races died out during the long peace of
Henry; when the anarchy came, men tore one another
in pieces on other pretences. But now Englishmen still
go forth to withstand a Norman invasion, Englishmen
marked off by the English name, not only from men of
other lands, but also, though for the last time, from
men who were not English within the English kingdom
itself.</p>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile the exhortations of the Bishop of Durham
had had their effect on the sluggish mind of the Norman
Duke. <span class="sni">Robert’s fleet. July, 1101.</span>

The

As of old, the <dfn>fyrd</dfn> flocked together

great moral powers, the people and the Church. <span class="sni">Anselm and his contingent.</span>
There

not surely to wield
weapons with his own hands; but doubtless to bring
about peace, if so he could, and, failing that, to exhort
his flock to the last and most terrible of duties, to fight
without flinching in a righteous war, when peace has
become hopeless. It was not Anselm’s first sight of warfare;
but he might now learn the difference between
Duke Roger’s war of aggression against Capua, and the
war which the English people were ready to wage for
their native land and their native king.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1024" id="fnanchor_1024"></a><a href="#footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The English at Pevensey.</span>
The King and
the Primate, the national force ready to act at their
bidding, the stranger nobles ready to betray them to the
<a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a><span class="pageno">404</span>

Pevensey.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1025" id="fnanchor_1025"></a><a href="#footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a></span>
There two invading Norman fleets had
already shown themselves, with widely different results
from their invasions. <span class="sni">William Count of Mortain.</span>
The third was looked for on the
same spot, perhaps all the more because of the very
doubtful faith of the new lord of Pevensey, Count William
of Mortain. For that same reason it was all the
more needful to secure such a post against the invaders.
At Pevensey then, under the ancient walls and the new
donjon, the army came together, waiting for the coming
of the hostile fleet. But Henry took means to check
them on their voyage. <span class="sni">The English fleet sent out.</span>
He sent forth his ships to watch
the coasts, to watch the enemy and to hinder them from
landing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1026" id="fnanchor_1026"></a><a href="#footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></span>
But here we are met with a somewhat strange
fact. <span class="sni">Some of the crews desert to Robert.</span>
This is not the first time that we have found
Englishmen at sea less faithful than Englishmen on
land. Tostig found allies among the sailors who were
sent to meet him;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1027" id="fnanchor_1027"></a><a href="#footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></span>
so now did Robert. Some of the
crews threw aside their allegiance, joined the invaders,
and guided them to land. <span class="sni">Alleged agency of Flambard.</span>
This piece of treason is attributed
to the craft and subtlety of the Bishop of Durham,
perhaps only, as in the case of Eadric, from the general
belief that, whatever mischief was done, he must have
been the doer of it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1028" id="fnanchor_1028"></a><a href="#footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a><span class="pageno">405</span>
<span class="sni">Coming of Robert and his fleet.</span> This time the landing-place was not Pevensey, but it
was a kindred spot. One writer contrasts Robert’s invasion
with that of his father. William made his way
into the land by his own strength, Robert only by the
help of traitors.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1029" id="fnanchor_1029"></a><a href="#footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Comparison with his former attempt.</span>
But it might have been only fair to
contrast Robert’s former attempt, when he sent others
to land at Pevensey, but made no attempt to land anywhere
himself, and this present attempt, when he came
in his own person and actually landed on English
ground. And the first and the third invasion have one
point of likeness as distinguished from the second. The
second invasion, that in the days of Rufus, was beaten
back, because the attempt was made on Pevensey when
Pevensey was well defended. <span class="sni">Comparison of Harold and Henry.</span>
But as the Conqueror
was able to land at Pevensey because Harold was far
away in Yorkshire, so, because Henry was carefully
guarding Pevensey, Robert was able to land elsewhere.
The traitors guided his fleet along the narrow seas
which had seen the Saxon landings which came next
after those which made Anderida a wilderness. As the
father had made his way to England almost in the wake
of Ælle and Cissa, so the son made his way into England
more nearly in the wake of Cerdic and Cynric. <span class="sni">Robert lands at Portchester. July 20, 1101.</span>
The
Norman fleet sailed up the haven of Portsmouth, and
the Duke and his army landed as safely beneath the
Roman walls of Portchester as his father and his army
had landed beneath the Roman walls of Pevensey.
<span class="sni">Portchester castle and church.</span>
Those walls at least were there; the massive keep most
likely was not yet; the priory of Austin canons, whose
church, little altered, still abides within the castle walls,
<a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a><span class="pageno">406</span>
was the work of Henry himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1030" id="fnanchor_1030"></a><a href="#footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Robert marches to besiege Winchester.</span>
From Portchester the
invader naturally marched towards Winchester; there
was the royal seat; there was the royal hoard. He
pitched his camp in a fit place for a siege;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1031" id="fnanchor_1031"></a><a href="#footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a></span>
<span class="sni">He declines to attack the city because of the Queen.</span>
but, in one
of his fits of generosity, he refused, on a purely personal
ground, to attack the city. His godchild and sister-in-law
Queen Matilda was already lying there in child-bed
of her first child, either the Ætheling or the future Empress.
Was the West-Saxon capital her morning-gift
also, as it had been with Emma and the elder Eadgyth?
When Robert heard of the Queen’s case, he turned away,
saying that it would be the deed of a villain to assault
the city at such a time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1032" id="fnanchor_1032"></a><a href="#footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Estimate of his conduct.</span>
In this story we see the better side of Robert, that
spirit of true personal kindliness, which, like his dealings
with his brother Henry at the siege of Saint Michael’s
Mount, calls forth a personal liking for him in spite
of all his follies and vices. But one and the same
fallacy runs through all these stories of passing personal
<a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a><span class="pageno">407</span>
generosity. War cannot be carried on without causing
much distress to many people, to besieged garrisons suffering
from thirst, to women in child-bed, and others.
Therefore war should never be undertaken, except for
some public object so great and righteous as to outweigh
the distress caused to individuals. Therefore too
he who is carrying on a war on what he believes to be
adequate grounds, should not turn aside from any operation
which will promote the cause which he has in hand,
merely on account of the distress which it may cause to
individuals. We can hardly fancy that Robert himself
would have turned away from the siege of Jerusalem or
Antioch out of thought for any single person, even a
brother or sister. He would have felt such an act to be
treason to the common cause of Christendom. At Saint
Michael’s Mount and at Winchester he had no cause to
betray; he was simply fighting for his own interests,
which he might, if he chose, forbear to assert. The
morality of his age, perhaps the military morality of
any age, fails to see that what this proves is that he
should not have been attacking Winchester or the
Mount at all. Unless war is so high a duty as to outweigh
all personal considerations, it is a crime.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Personal character of the chivalrous feeling.</span>
Again, in all these stories we see how the chivalrous
spirit thinks of those only whose rank or kindred or
some other personal cause brings their distress directly
home to its thoughts. Others on the Mount were thirsty
besides Henry; Winchester must have contained other
women in child-bed besides Matilda. But Robert thinks
only of those who are personally connected with himself.
Of course that abstract way of looking at the matter
which strict morality dictates is quite foreign to the
notions of the eleventh century or of many later centuries,
and must therefore not be pressed too far. And
undoubtedly the personal kindliness which is always
<a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a><span class="pageno">408</span>
shown by Duke Robert is quite enough to put him on
another moral level from a monster like Robert of Bellême.
It is also enough to put him on another level
from William Rufus, whose generosity is simply a form
of pride. Yet, after all, the Red King’s abiding duty
and reverence towards his father, alive and dead, comes
nearer to a moral principle than Robert’s momentary
outbursts of kindly feeling.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Robert’s march from Winchester.</span>
From Winchester Robert is said to have turned towards
London, under the belief that Henry was there.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1033" id="fnanchor_1033"></a><a href="#footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></span>
This is somewhat strange, as one would think that the
sea-faring men who had guided him to Portchester must
both themselves have known, and would take care to let
him know, that the King was at Pevensey. But nothing
would be more natural than that Robert should march
on London while the King was known to be elsewhere.
And the point where, in the only account which
attempts any geographical detail, the armies are said to
have met, suggests a march of Robert towards London,
and a march of Henry from Pevensey designed to meet
him on the road before he should reach London. <span class="sni">The armies meet near Alton.</span>
Robert
was by the wood of Alton when news was brought to
him that his brother’s force was near, on the other side of
the wood.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1034" id="fnanchor_1034"></a><a href="#footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></span>
This seems a likely point for the armies to
<a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a><span class="pageno">409</span>
meet, when the one was going north-east from Portchester
and the other going north-west from Pevensey. Wherever
the spot was, the two hosts met face to face and
made ready for battle. But, either then or earlier, many
of the Norman barons in Henry’s army openly forsook
the King’s cause and went over to the invaders. <span class="sni">Desertion of the Earls of Shrewsbury and Surrey.</span>
Two
of the traitors are mentioned by name. Robert of
Bellême, who was a little time before plotting in Normandy
in his character of lord of Montgomery, must now
have been again in England to work this open treason
in his character of Earl of Shrewsbury. The other was
the King’s cousin, the Earl of Surrey, the younger William
of Warren, who is spoken of as a bitter personal
enemy of the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1035" id="fnanchor_1035"></a><a href="#footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></span>
<span class="sni">William of Warren’s enmity to the King.</span>
Henry had, even in his charter of
liberties, kept the forests in his own hands; for, besides
his wars, his studies, and his love-intrigues, he found
time for an indulgence in hunting, which even surpassed,
it would seem, the measure of his fellows. <span class="sni">His jests on the King’s love of hunting.</span>
This drew
on him the mockery of Earl William, who jeered at his
deer-slaying exploits, and bestowed on him the nickname
of <span class="title">Hartsfoot</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1036" id="fnanchor_1036"></a><a href="#footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a></span>
To mockery he now added treason,
<a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a><span class="pageno">410</span>
and Henry did not forget either. <span class="sni">Doubtful truth of other nobles.</span>
While these great
lords forsook the King, other Norman nobles still clave
to him outwardly, but only with a feigned heart. His
trust was in the small band of faithful Normans, in the
Primate and the bishops, and above all in the English
people. <span class="sni">Death of Earl Hugh. July 26, 1101.</span>
One of his oldest Norman friends was gone;
Earl Hugh had ended his long and turbulent life as a
three-days’-old monk in the house of Saint Werburh,
the house which was the joint work of himself and
Anselm.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1037" id="fnanchor_1037"></a><a href="#footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile every motive of religion, loyalty, and
patriotism, was brought to bear on the minds of the
royal army. While some among the barons were openly
falling off, while the good faith of others was doubtful,
the King put his whole trust in Anselm only. The
Primate was set to exhort, publicly and privately, all
whose defection was feared.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1038" id="fnanchor_1038"></a><a href="#footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Anselm’s energy on the King’s side.</span>
And exhort he did, and
with good success, hindering at least any further open revolt.
Robert himself was alarmed at the threat of excommunication
which Anselm held over him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1039" id="fnanchor_1039"></a><a href="#footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></span>
In the belief
of Anselm’s biographer, the King at this moment owed
his crown to the Archbishop.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1040" id="fnanchor_1040"></a><a href="#footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Henry’s promises to Anselm.</span>
It is added that, in this
<a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a><span class="pageno">411</span>
moment of danger, Henry promised, not only to let Anselm
exercise his full jurisdiction undisturbed, but also to
obey in his own person all the decrees and orders of the
Apostolic See.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1041" id="fnanchor_1041"></a><a href="#footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a></span>
The former part of the promise Henry
cannot be fairly charged with breaking; the latter engagement,
if it was ever made at all, must surely have been
made under some qualification, or else it must be referred
to the same class of promises as the suggested grants of
London and York. Still there can be no doubt that
Anselm served the King well and loyally, and that his
help went far to keep many wavering souls in their
allegiance. <span class="sni">Zeal of the English.</span>
But the mass of the English army hardly
needed exhortation to keep them in their duty. They
would perhaps be more deeply stirred by the voice of
the King himself than even by that of the Primate.
Never yet since the day of Senlac had Englishmen harnessed
for the battle heard a crowned king call on them
in their native tongue. <span class="sni">Exhortation of the King.</span>
But now we see Henry marshalling
his ranks in the old tactics, and speaking to his
Englishmen as Brihtnoth or Harold might have spoken.
The lifeless Latin catches some spark or echo from the
song of Maldon, when King Henry rides round the
wedge of warriors, and bids them meet the charge of
the Norman knights by standing firm in the array of
the ancient shield-wall. No wonder that their hearts were
stirred; no wonder that they shouted loud for the battle,
and told their King with one voice that they were ready
for the work, and feared not a Norman in the invading
host.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1042" id="fnanchor_1042"></a><a href="#footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a></span></p>

<span class="sni">Negotiations between Henry and Robert.</span>
But the merits of the Norman lance and the English
battle-axe were not again to be put to the trial on
English ground. Harold and William had tried negotiation
before the final appeal to arms; how much more
then should the brothers Henry and Robert? <span class="sni">Message of Henry.</span>
The King
of the English first sent a herald to the invader to ask
why he had dared to enter his kingdom in arms.
<span class="sni">Robert’s answer.</span>
Robert sent word back again that it was the kingdom of
his father which he had entered, and that he demanded it
as his due by the right of elder birth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1043" id="fnanchor_1043"></a><a href="#footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His claim of elder birth.</span>
In English ears
this appeal to the new-fangled notions of other lands
must have sounded meaningless. To whom could a
crown be due but to him to whom the folk of his land
had given it? What was Robert and his elder birth to
them? He, the stranger-born, might, for aught they
knew, be the eldest son of Duke William of Normandy;
but King Henry, the countryman of his people, was the
only son of King William of England. Other messages
followed; wise men on both sides sought to bring
about a reconciliation between the brothers; others
sought war rather than peace.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1044" id="fnanchor_1044"></a><a href="#footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Personal meeting of the brothers.</span>
We read on the one
hand that, after many messages had gone to and fro,
the King found that he could trust no negotiator but
himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1045" id="fnanchor_1045"></a><a href="#footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a></span>
Yet we hear also of Henry being represented
by Robert Fitz-hamon, who was surely faithful, while
the representatives of Robert are somewhat strangely
said to have been two of Henry’s own rebels, the
Earl of Shrewsbury and the lord of Cornwall.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1046" id="fnanchor_1046"></a><a href="#footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a></span>
However
<a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a><span class="pageno">413</span>
this may be, those on both sides who shrank from
a war of brothers brought about a personal interview
between the rival princes. Nothing could be more to
the advantage of the calm genius of Henry. Robert,
able to negotiate for others, was sure not to be able to
negotiate for himself. The hosts of Normandy and England
stood marshalled in all their pride of war, while the
King and the Duke went forth alone into the plain between
them. <span class="sni">They agree on terms.</span>
The brothers talked together; after a while
they embraced and kissed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1047" id="fnanchor_1047"></a><a href="#footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></span>
Terms of agreement had
been come to which were to save the blood of the
subjects of both.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">The treaty of 1101. Robert gives up all claim to England; Henry gives up his Norman possessions.</span>
By the treaty now sworn to Robert gave up all claim
to the kingdom of England. Henry, on his part, gave
up to Robert his county of Coutances, and all that he
possessed within the borders of Normandy. One continental
possession alone, a small and isolated one, he
kept. He might give up the lands which he had once
bought of Robert and which he had afterwards received
in fief of William. <span class="sni">He keeps Domfront.</span>
But he could not give up the town
and castle of Domfront, whose people had of their own
free will chosen him as their lord, and had received his
oath never to give them over to any other lord. Domfront
therefore, the border post of Normandy and Maine, once
the solitary possession of the wanderer, now remained
the solitary continental possession of the island king.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1048" id="fnanchor_1048"></a><a href="#footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Henry and Helias neighbours.</span>
Thus, in his small dominion on the mainland, Henry had
<a name="line413_6" id="line413_6"></a>in a neighbour his friend and ally Count Helias, a neighbourhood
which had some influence on the events of a
few years later. <span class="sni">Yearly payment to Robert. Stipulation as to the succession.</span>
Besides the territorial cessions, the
Duke was to receive a yearly payment of three thousand
pounds from his brother. The vain provision was again
inserted that, if either brother died without lawful issue
<a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a><span class="pageno">414</span>
in the lifetime of the other, the survivor should succeed
to his dominions. Such a provision might seem even
vainer than ever, now that both brothers were lately
married to young and fruitful wives. <span class="sni">Dying out of the legitimate male line of both brothers.</span>
Yet it is strange
to look forward, and to see how each brother outlived
his son, and how short a time the younger brother outlived
the elder. Neither Robert nor Henry could have
dreamed that the succession of both would pass to the son
of their sister at Chartres. <span class="sni">Natural sons of Henry.</span>
Anyhow the arrangement
shut out those who afterwards showed themselves to be,
in personal qualities, the most worthy to reign. These
were the natural sons of Henry. <span class="sni">Earl Robert.</span>
Robert, the son of the
unknown French mother, came to fill no small place in
history as the renowned Earl of Gloucester; <span class="sni">Richard.</span>
and the
short life of Richard, the son of the Berkshire widow,
showed him as a gallant soldier and something more.
Thus the relations and the succession of the two states
of Normandy and England were settled. But a personal
matter still remained between the princes. <span class="sni">Henry released from his homage to Robert.</span>
At some
earlier time, most likely when he first received the
Côtentin, Henry had become the man of Robert. But
now Henry was a king; Robert was to remain only
a duke. It was not becoming for a crowned and
anointed king to be the man of a mere duke. Henry
was therefore released from all personal obligations of
homage towards his brother. <span class="sni">Each prince to restore the partisans of the other.</span>
Lastly, a provision borrowed
from the elder treaty was inserted, seemingly
only for form’s sake. Each prince bound himself to
restore the lands and honours of all men who had
suffered forfeiture for supporting the cause of the other.
<span class="sni">The treaty sworn to.</span>
The treaty thus agreed to was, like the elder one, confirmed
by the oaths of twelve of the chief men on each
side.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1049" id="fnanchor_1049"></a><a href="#footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a></span>

1102.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Continued disloyalty of the Norman nobles.</span>
King Henry was now made fast in his kingdom; but
he still had enemies to strive against. The allegiance of
many of the chief men of Norman birth in England was
still not a little doubtful. They had to be fully brought
under the royal power before either the King or his
kingdom could be safe. <span class="sni">Henry’s plan for breaking the power of the great barons.</span>
Henry, there can be little
doubt, cold and calculating as he was, formed a settled
plan for breaking the power of those great barons who,
at least if they joined together, might easily make themselves
dangerous to the peace of the land. It was not
his policy to hurry, nor to make over-many enemies by
attacking all the dangerous men at once. The work
was to be done bit by bit; opportunities were to be
found as they offered themselves, to settle matters with
those who had been traitors once and who were likely
to be traitors again.</p>

<p><span class="sni">The treaty does not apply to Flambard.</span>
To some of the most dangerous traitors of all the
provisions of the late treaty did not apply. The Bishop
of Durham had lost nothing in the cause of Duke
Robert. He had been imprisoned, and his temporalities
had been seized, on the ground of his old offences,
<a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a><span class="pageno">416</span>
before Robert’s claims had been heard of. He had no
claims to restoration, nor did he as yet find any favour.
<span class="sni">Death of Gilbert Bishop of Lisieux. August, 1101.</span>
He went back to Normandy, and there, in his banishment
to his native land, he found means to provide for himself
at the cost of one of its bishoprics. Gilbert Maminot, the
skilful leech whom the Conqueror had placed in the see
of Lisieux,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1051" id="fnanchor_1051"></a><a href="#footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a></span>
died in August, while Duke Robert was in
England. <span class="sni">Fulcher, Flambard’s brother, holds the see. June 1102-January 1103.</span>
The see was not filled till the next June, when
it was given to Flambard’s brother Fulcher, who was
consecrated and held the bishopric with a good reputation
for liberality till his death seven months later. Then
Flambard caused the see to be bestowed on a young son
of his own, Thomas by name. As far as a not very intelligible
account can be made out, Thomas remained unconsecrated,
while his father received the revenues.  <span class="sni">Flambard receives the revenues under cover of his son.</span>
It was
not till after Henry’s conquest of Normandy that a more
regular appointment to the bishopric was made.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1052" id="fnanchor_1052"></a><a href="#footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Banishment of the Earl of Surrey.</span>
Earl William of Warren too paid the penalty of rebellion,
rebellion aggravated by personal gibes against the
King. If our accounts are correct, he was disinherited so
soon that he went away to Normandy in company with
Duke Robert. He is said to have had other companions in
the same case.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1053" id="fnanchor_1053"></a><a href="#footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a></span>
He was afterwards restored at Robert’s
intercession; but the chronology is confused, and we may
guess that his fall did not happen quite so soon as is
said. If he did suffer forfeiture directly after the treaty,
it must have been on some other ground, and not that of
taking Robert’s side during the quarrel, which would
have been covered by the treaty. On Earl William
<a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a><span class="pageno">417</span>
chastisement had a good effect; <span class="sni">His restoration.</span>

<p><span class="sni">Henry’s rewards and punishments.</span>
Other dangerous persons were got rid of one by one,
as occasion served. Henry rewarded bountifully all
who served him faithfully; but no enemy escaped him;
no traitor avoided forfeiture or heavy fines.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1055" id="fnanchor_1055"></a><a href="#footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a></span>
Forfeiture
came before long on some men who were, after the earls,
among the greatest of the men of Norman birth in
England. <span class="sni">Banishment of Robert Malet; of Robert of Pontefract.</span>
Such was Robert Malet, son of the gossip of
King Harold, a man great in the east of England. Such
was one equally great in the north, Robert of Pontefract,
the son of Ilbert of Lacy. Charges were brought against
them in the King’s court, and forfeiture and banishment
followed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1056" id="fnanchor_1056"></a><a href="#footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a></span>
In another case we know the exact nature
of the charge, nor can we condemn the punishment,
except so far as it was turned to the private advantage
of a favourite. <span class="sni">Private war unlawful in England.</span>
It was our boast in England that we

<span class="sni">Ivo of Grantmesnil harries his neighbours’ lands.</span>
But now Ivo of Grantmesnil,
the rope-dancer of Antioch, took upon him to bring the

could not be passed by in the days of the King who had

A bargain was struck; Count
Robert was to give Ivo five hundred marks towards his
journey to Palestine, and was in return to take possession
of all Ivo’s lands for fifteen years. Then they were
to go back to his son Ivo, now a child, who was to

The elder Ivo went on his second crusade with
his wife, the daughter of Gilbert of Ghent, and died on his
pilgrimage. With him ended the short-lived greatness
of the house of Grantmesnil in England. The inheritance

younger Ivo to swell the fortunes of the chief counsellor
of the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1061" id="fnanchor_1061"></a><a href="#footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Origin of the earldom of Leicester.</span>
The subtlety of the Count of Meulan was famous, and
it enabled him to change his fifteen years’ possession of
the lands of Ivo of Grantmesnil into a great hereditary
earldom. A chief part of Ivo’s position came from his
relations to the town of Leicester. <span class="sni">Ivo’s relations with Leicester.</span> He had succeeded

and which has drawn to itself alike the glory of a Montfort
and the shame of a Dudley. <span class="sni">Dies, 1118.</span>
Earl Robert kept his
office and his prosperity for the remaining fifteen years
of his life, and then died, fifty-two years after the great

he was the father of two sons, both of whom

still young, hold logical disputations with cardinals.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1068" id="fnanchor_1068"></a><a href="#footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a></span>
Of
these brothers, Robert, the elder, became a prosperous

<a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a><span class="pageno">420</span>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Christmas Gemót. 1101&ndash;1102.</span> King Henry had thus overthrown several of his open
or secret enemies, and he doubtless wore his crown at
the Christmas Gemót at Westminster with a greater
feeling of safety. But the greatest work of all had still
to be done. There was still one man in England whose
presence was utterly inconsistent with the rule of any
king whose mind was to give peace to his kingdom.
<span class="sni">Danger from Robert of Bellême.</span>
Peace, in Henry’s sense of the word, could not be in a
land where Robert of Bellême was, to say the least, the
<a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a><span class="pageno">421</span>
mightiest man after the King. Henry knew his man;
he knew that, sooner or later, the struggle must come
between himself and such a subject. <span class="sni">The King watches him.</span>
For a whole year
he kept his eye upon the Earl of Shropshire and all his
doings. Spies sent from the King watched all that he
did; every blameworthy act was carefully reported and
set down in writing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1074" id="fnanchor_1074"></a><a href="#footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a></span>
A bulky volume, one would
think, must have been added to the library of the
learned King. At last the moment came when Henry
thought that it was time to act, and the form of action
which he took was one which followed more than one
precedent in earlier reigns. <span class="sni">Easter Gemót. April 6, 1102.</span>
The Easter Gemót was to
be held at Winchester. The King summoned Earl
Robert to appear before the Assembly, and to answer
openly on forty-five distinct charges of offences done
either against the King or against his brother the Duke.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1075" id="fnanchor_1075"></a><a href="#footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Robert asks a licence to be accompanied by his men.</span>
We do not read that Robert, like others in the like case
on earlier occasions, demanded a safe-conduct to go and
to return; but we do read that he demanded&mdash;&#8203;and it
is implied that the demand was an usual one&mdash;&#8203;a licence
to come accompanied by his men. <span class="sni">The licence is given.</span>
They were to serve,
we may suppose, either as compurgators or as defenders
by the strong hand, as things might turn out.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1076" id="fnanchor_1076"></a><a href="#footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></span>

The demand was granted; Earl Roger set forth; the King
and his barons were waiting for his coming at Winchester;
but he came not. <span class="sni">Robert does not come.</span>
On the road he changed his
mind; he knew that the result of any legal trial must be
<a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a><span class="pageno">422</span>
against him; he deemed, and doubtless with truth, that
he would be safer in his own strong castles than he
could be in the King’s court. He fled, we are told,
breathless and afraid, a description which does not
savour much of the fierce lord of Bellême. But at any
rate the King’s messenger had to report that the Earl of
Shropshire had gone elsewhere, and was not on his way
to obey the King’s summons.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1077" id="fnanchor_1077"></a><a href="#footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The King’s proclamation.</span>
Henry did not hurry;
he put forth a proclamation, declaring that the Earl,
lawfully charged with various crimes, had not come to
make his defence, and that, if he did not come at once to
do right&mdash;&#8203;to abide his trial&mdash;&#8203;he would be declared an
outlaw.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1078" id="fnanchor_1078"></a><a href="#footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a></span>
<span class="sni">He again summons Robert, who refuses to come.</span>
Along with the issue of the public proclamation,
the King, clearly anxious to give no occasion for
any man to say that the Earl had been harshly or informally
treated, sent him a second personal summons
to appear before the Assembly. This time Robert
directly refused to come,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1079" id="fnanchor_1079"></a><a href="#footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a></span>
and open war broke out. <span class="sni">The war begins.</span>
The
work of King Henry, as we have already heard, was to
destroy the ungodly within his kingdom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1080" id="fnanchor_1080"></a><a href="#footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a></span>
He had to
<a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a><span class="pageno">423</span>
begin by doing that useful work on an offender whose
ungodliness was on the grandest scale of all.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Greatness of Robert’s possessions.</span>
The overweening greatness of the house of Montgomery
or Bellême, and the personal energy of its
members, is shown in the range both of warfare and
of negotiation which was opened by what was in its
beginning a mere legal process on the part of the King
of the English against an offending subject. We must
always remember that, whatever Robert was at Shrewsbury
or at Montgomery, at Bellême he was something
more than an ordinary vassal of either king or duke.
<span class="sni">His acquisition of Ponthieu.</span>
He had lately increased his continental power by taking
possession of the county of Ponthieu, the inheritance of
his son, who bore the name of his own maternal grandfather,
the terrible William Talvas.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1081" id="fnanchor_1081"></a><a href="#footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></span>
The Earl of Shrewsbury
was thus entitled to deal with princes as one of
their own order. <span class="sni">His brothers Arnulf and Roger.</span>
He and the two best known of his
brothers, those whom we have already seen leagued
with him, Arnulf of Montgomery, lord of Pembroke,
and Roger of Poitou, once lord of the land between
Mersey and Ribble, were now again firmly joined together
against the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1082" id="fnanchor_1082"></a><a href="#footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Wide range of warfare and negotiation.</span>
And they contrived to draw no small part of Northern Europe into a partnership in
their private quarrel. That Robert of Bellême should
be able to get together a large body of Welsh allies is in
no way wonderful. He was indeed the sternest enemy
of their nation; <span class="sni">Welsh alliance of Robert.</span> but, among that divided people, enmity
on the part of one tribe or dynasty was a claim to support
on the part of another, and all tribes and dynasties
<a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a><span class="pageno">424</span>
forgot every enmity and every wrong when there was
a chance of harrying the fields and homes of the Saxon.
Welsh allies of the rebel Earl play an important part in
the story, and the more distant powers of Ireland and
Norway are also brought within its page.</p>

<p>Just at this time the Welsh seem to have been
stronger and more united than usual. We have seen
that their momentary subjugation after the death of Earl
Hugh of Shropshire had led to a successful movement
while his successor was busy on the continent.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1083" id="fnanchor_1083"></a><a href="#footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Revolt in Gwynedd.</span>
The
men of Gwynedd could not bear Norman rule; whether
it took the form of law or of unlaw, it was equally
against the grain. Their leader now was Owen son of
Edwin, who, we are told, had been the first to bring the
French into Mona.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1084" id="fnanchor_1084"></a><a href="#footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Settlement of Gruffydd and of Cadwgan and his brothers.</span>
This was before the end of the year

The phrase of the Welsh writer, that they
came to terms with “the French,” must be understood
as referring to their relations with Robert of Bellême.
Cadwgan kept Ceredigion and a part of Powys, for which
he and his brothers Jorwerth and Meredydd became
the men of the Earl of Shropshire. Gruffydd seems to
have held Anglesey as a wholly independent prince;
there is at least no mention of vassalage in his case.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1086" id="fnanchor_1086"></a><a href="#footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a></span>
<a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a><span class="pageno">425</span>
<span class="sni">Robert calls on the Welsh for help;</span>
Earl Robert now called on his British vassals to help
him in his struggle with the King. As there is no sign
that they had become the men either of King Henry
or of any earlier king, the law of Salisbury did not
apply to them. <span class="sni">his gifts and promises.</span>
The promises of Robert of Bellême were
splendid; so were his gifts; he almost seems to have
won the help of the Britons by a promised restoration of
complete freedom to their country.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1087" id="fnanchor_1087"></a><a href="#footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></span>
In the allies thus
drawn to his banners he professed the most boundless
trust. He put into their hands&mdash;&#8203;so the Welsh writer
tells us&mdash;&#8203;his wealth and his cattle, perhaps also, what a
Norman lord would specially value, the horses of noble
breed which he had brought over from Spain, and whose
race flourished in the land of Powys long after.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1088" id="fnanchor_1088"></a><a href="#footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a></span>
A great
and motley host was thus got together, which entered
zealously into the cause of the Earl, and did not pass by
so good an opportunity of finding great spoil.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1089" id="fnanchor_1089"></a><a href="#footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Arnulf’s dealings with Murtagh.</span>
Meanwhile the Earl’s brother Arnulf at once strengthened
the castle of Pembroke and looked further for allies
than the land of Ceredigion and Powys. By the hands
of his steward at Pembroke, Gerald of Windsor, he sent
to Ireland to King Murtagh, to ask for the king’s
daughter in marriage and for help in the struggle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1090" id="fnanchor_1090"></a><a href="#footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a></span>

<span class="sni">Negotiation with Magnus.</span>
From what followed, and from the connexion between
Murtagh and Magnus, we can hardly doubt that the
negotiations of Arnulf reached to Norway as well as to
Ireland, and that Magnus himself was a party to the
course which was at once followed by Murtagh. <span class="sni">Murtagh sends his daughter to Arnulf.</span>
The
Irish king promised his daughter to the lord of Pembroke,
in some sort his neighbour, and actually sent her
to her affianced husband on board a great fleet designed

<p>King Henry had thus plenty of foes to strive against
in his work of bringing back the reign of law and order
in his kingdom. <span class="sni">Henry’s negotiation with Duke Robert.</span>
But he too could negotiate beyond sea;
he could stir up a diversion against the Count of Bellême
and Ponthieu, which might do something to weaken
the power of the Earl of Shropshire and lord of Arundel.
The King sent letters to his brother Duke Robert, setting
forth how Earl Robert had incurred forfeiture in the
dominions of both of them, and how he had treasonably
refused to appear in the general Assembly of England.
He called on his brother to do as he was doing himself,
and to smite the man who was a traitor to both his
lords with the vengeance that was his due.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1092" id="fnanchor_1092"></a><a href="#footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a></span>
The Duke
attempted something after his fashion, that is his fashion
in Normandy and not his fashion in Syria. The man
who had been foremost in the crusading host had on his
native soil sunk again into the feeble and half-hearted
ruler whom we knew of old. <span class="sni">Duke Robert besieges Vignats.</span>
Yet he did make an
attempt to subdue the castles which held out for Robert

<a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a><span class="pageno">427</span>
Vignats, a castle lying south-east of Falaise, on a height

It was now held on

<span class="sni">Truce with the besieged.</span>
The zeal of the defenders of Arundel in the
cause of their rebel lord does not seem to have been
strong; but they had a keen sense either of the honour
of soldiers or of the duty of vassals. This last, to be
sure, was a mistaken sense, according to the laws of
England, above all according to the great law of
Salisbury. They craved a truce, during which they
might ask Earl Robert either to send them help or
to give them leave to surrender. Robert was far away
in his Mercian earldom, busy on two works. <span class="sni">Robert and Arnulf harry Staffordshire.</span>

forth to him the danger in which they stood from the
King’s leaguer. <span class="sni">Terms of the surrender of Arundel.</span>
Mournful, but feeling himself unable to

they could with the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1104" id="fnanchor_1104"></a><a href="#footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a></span>
They surrendered at once

them with rich gifts.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1105" id="fnanchor_1105"></a><a href="#footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a></span>
Arundel passed into the
royal hands, to become in the next reign the seat of a
more abiding earldom in the hands of the famous houses
of Aubigny and Fitzalan, and to pass through them to
the more modern, but perhaps more English, line of
Howard.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1106" id="fnanchor_1106"></a><a href="#footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></span></p>

The surrender of Arundel took away all fear lest any
help should come to Robert of Bellême from his Norman
partisans. But before the King made any movement
towards the lands on the Severn, he marched far to the
north-east, to the lands watered by the tributaries of the
northern Ouse, on the borders of Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.
<span class="sni">Surrender of Tickhill.</span>

The more distant possessions of the rebel Earl were

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Relation of Normans and English.</span>
And now we get one of our most instructive pictures
of the time, and of the difference of feeling among men
of the time. We distinctly see the difference of feeling
between Normans and English. But they are no longer
labelled as Normans and English, as they were only a
year before. They are spoken of simply as different
classes in one army. Six-and-thirty years after the day
of Senlac, we are but seldom dealing with the men who
fought for Harold or for William; we have come to their
sons or even their grandsons. <span class="sni">Division of feeling in the army.</span>
But the great men of the
army and the small men, of whom the former class would
be all but wholly Norman, while the latter would be
Normans and English intermingled in various proportions,
had quite different views as to the proper policy
for King Henry to follow. And King Henry’s own views
agreed with the views of the small men, and not with
the views of the great. <span class="sni">Siege of Bridgenorth. The King builds a <span class="title">Malvoisin</span>.</span>
The army was gathered before
Bridgenorth, and a regular siege was opened. The King
brought up his engines of war; he built a fort to check the
approach of any relief to the castle<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1121" id="fnanchor_1121"></a><a href="#footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;was it on Oldbury,
was it on the northern side, beyond the surviving gate of
the town, or did it guard the river from the opposite side
<a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a><span class="pageno">436</span>
of the bridge? The siege lasted three weeks;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1122" id="fnanchor_1122"></a><a href="#footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a></span>
and the
course of events shows that it cannot have been at any
very late stage of it that King Henry found that he had
in his camp two widely different classes of men. There
were in it men who were working honestly in his service,
men who strove heartily for his success, knowing that
the interests of King and people were the same. There
were also men there to whom the interests of their own
order were dearer than those of either King or people,
and who feared that the overthrow of the power of the
Earl of Shropshire might tend to the lessening of their
own power, perhaps of their own possessions. We have
seen the same division of feeling before the walls of
Rochester;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1123" id="fnanchor_1123"></a><a href="#footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a></span>
we now see it beneath the cliff of Bridgenorth.
<span class="sni">The great men lean to Robert of Bellême.</span>
The earls and great men of the kingdom who
were in the army came together in separate consultations.
They argued that it was not for their interest
that the power of Robert of Bellême should be utterly
broken. If the King dealt so with the greatest of his
nobles, he might deal in the like sort with the rest, and
might tread them under his feet like servants and handmaidens.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1124" id="fnanchor_1124"></a><a href="#footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a></span>
It would suit them far better to bring about
a peace between the King and the Earl. It would have
been, one may guess, a peace by which Robert of Bellême
should keep his earldom and the castles within his
earldom, but should leave to the King the castles and
<a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a><span class="pageno">437</span>
lands which the King had already won. In this way
they would put an end to disputes, and would make
both the King and the Earl their debtors.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1125" id="fnanchor_1125"></a><a href="#footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">The smaller men, Normans and English, faithful to the King.</span>
So reasoned the great men, the Norman nobles, the
men to most of whom Robert of Bellême was a countryman
and a comrade, and none of whom were likely to
have felt the grip of his iron claws<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1126" id="fnanchor_1126"></a><a href="#footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a></span>
in their own persons.
So reasoned not the sons of the soil; so reasoned
not men of any race who were lowly enough to feel that
in the power of the King&mdash;&#8203;that is in Henry’s days, the
power of law&mdash;&#8203;lay their only hope of shelter against
smaller oppressors. <span class="sni">Meeting of the nobles.</span>
The great men came together in a
field&mdash;&#8203;perhaps in the meadows beside the Severn&mdash;&#8203;and
there held a <em>parliament</em> with the King&mdash;&#8203;a meeting, one
might say, of the Witan from which the land-sitting
men were shut out&mdash;&#8203;and earnestly pressed peace upon
the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1127" id="fnanchor_1127"></a><a href="#footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a></span>
Henry’s own feelings were clearly the other
way; and those who were shut out from the counsels of
the great ones now came to his help. <span class="sni">Gathering of the mass of the army.</span>
Three thousand
men of the mass of the army, men seemingly of the
shire most nearly concerned, who were stationed on one
of the neighbouring hills, knew, by whatever means, the
counsel of the leaders, and were minded to have their
voice in the matter too.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1128" id="fnanchor_1128"></a><a href="#footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></span>

they
<a name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a><span class="pageno">438</span>
had a right to be heard as well as men of higher degree.
At Rochester too the English soldiers had spoken their
minds; but to the Red King they must have spoken
them through an interpreter. But Henry knew the
tongue of his people, and we may fancy him not unwilling
to listen to counsels which he could hear and
weigh, while the mass of those of whom he had reason
to be jealous understood not what was said. <span class="sni">Appeal of the army to the King.</span>
A vigorous
speech, which doubtless fairly represents the feelings of the
moment, is put into the mouths of the three thousand or
their leaders; “Lord King Henry, trust not those traitors.
They do but strive to deceive you, and to take away
from you the strength of kingly justice. Why do you
listen to them who would have you spare the traitor
and leave unpunished the conspiracy of those who seek
your death? Behold we all stand by you faithfully;
we are ready to serve and help you in all things. Attack
the castle vigorously; shut in the traitor on all sides, and
make no peace with him till you have him alive or dead
in your hands.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1130" id="fnanchor_1130"></a><a href="#footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a></span>
The speakers do not call, as the English
before Rochester called in the case of Odo, for the judicial
death of the traitor. <span class="sni">Henry’s faith pledged for Robert’s life.</span>

But the three
thousand clearly cherished a hope, perhaps that Robert’s
own men might turn against him, certainly that, when
Bridgenorth should fall and Shrewsbury should be beleagued,
then some lucky bolt from an arrow or a
mangonel might light on him before the time of surrender
came, or, best of all for those who had felt his
iron claws, that he might fall beneath one of their own
axes in a sally or a storm.</p>

First of all, Henry
determined to weaken the strength of Robert, and no

annoyance, by detaching the Welsh force from the cause
of the rebels. <span class="sni">Dealings of William Pantulf with Jorwerth.</span>
William Pantulf, who was doubtless well
known to the Britons, acted as the King’s agent with Jorwerth
son of Bleddyn. We are not told why he was
thought more easy to win over than his brothers; but it
seems plain that the negotiation was carried on with
him only, unknown to Cadwgan and Meredydd.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1133" id="fnanchor_1133"></a><a href="#footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a></span>

Jorwerth came; the gifts of
King Henry were acceptable; his promises were magnificent
indeed. As long as Henry lived&mdash;&#8203;it was wise
not to bind his successor&mdash;&#8203;the British prince should
<a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a><span class="pageno">440</span>
have, free of all homage and all tribute, Powys, Ceredigion,
half Dyfed with the castle of Pembroke, the vale
of Teifi, Kidwelly, and Gower.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1135" id="fnanchor_1135"></a><a href="#footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a></span>
Such a dominion would
give its holder a seaboard on two seas; it would leave
under English rule little beyond the central and southern
lands of Brecheiniog, Gwent, and Morganwg, and the
outlying land of Pembroke, which would thus be most
distinctly “Little England beyond Wales.” We are not
told what was to be the fate of Cadwgan when Jorwerth
received this great inheritance; but Jorwerth himself
naturally caught at such a prospect. <span class="sni">Jorwerth makes the Welsh change sides.</span>
And it seems that
his power over his countrymen was so great that, while
his brothers knew nothing of what was going on, Jorwerth
was able to turn the whole British force which
had come to the Earl’s help to the side of the King.
The Welshmen now harried the lands of the Earl and
his friends instead of those of his enemies, and carried
off a vast booty.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1136" id="fnanchor_1136"></a><a href="#footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a></span>

Having thus relieved himself of the enemy who hung
upon his flanks, Henry began to deal directly with the
defenders of Bridgenorth. Three of the leaders&mdash;&#8203;we may
safely guess that Roger son of Corbet, Robert of Neville,
and Wulfgar, are the three meant&mdash;&#8203;were invited to the
King’s presence. They doubtless had a safe-conduct for
that once; but they had to take back an ugly message
to their comrades. The King swore in the hearing of all
men that, unless they surrendered the castle within three
<a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a><span class="pageno">441</span>
days, he would hang every man of the garrison that he
could catch.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1137" id="fnanchor_1137"></a><a href="#footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></span>
The three captains, whose necks were in
as much danger as those of their followers, began to consult
for their own safety. <span class="sni">Mediation of William Pantulf.</span>
They asked William Pantulf,
as their neighbour, to act as a mediator between them
and the King.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1138" id="fnanchor_1138"></a><a href="#footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a></span>
At their request, he came to them, and
made them a set speech on the duty of surrendering the
castle to the lawful king. And his eloquence was backed
by one special argument which shows that, in one point
at least, Henry had made some progress in the school
of Rufus. William was commissioned to swear in the
King’s name that submission should be rewarded by an
addition to the estates of each of the captains of lands
of a hundred pounds’ worth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1139" id="fnanchor_1139"></a><a href="#footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The captains promise to surrender.</span>
Moved, we are told, by a
sense of the common good, the captains agreed, and, to
avoid all further danger, submitted to the King’s will.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1140" id="fnanchor_1140"></a><a href="#footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a></span>
They were allowed to send a message to Earl Robert to
say that they could hold out no longer against the invincible
power of King Henry.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1141" id="fnanchor_1141"></a><a href="#footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sni">Position of Robert.</span>
Robert of Bellême was now nearly at the end of his
hopes and of his wits. His distant castles were lost;
Bridgenorth, his own work, his newest work, was as
good as lost; William Pantulf, able and active, had
<a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a><span class="pageno">442</span>
turned against him; his Welsh allies had failed him;
Cadwgan and Meredydd were still at his side;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1142" id="fnanchor_1142"></a><a href="#footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a></span>
but they
were useless guests now that Jorwerth had turned the
whole power of the Britons to the other side. He still
held Shrewsbury; but it was hard to defy the strength
of the whole kingdom from within the walls of a single
fortress. <span class="sni">His dealings with Ireland and Norway.</span> In his despair, he caught at the hope of making
his peace with the King;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1143" id="fnanchor_1143"></a><a href="#footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a></span>
he caught also at the most
distant chances of stirring up enemies against the King.
The Britons had proved a broken reed; he would try the
Irish and the Northmen. The Irish fleet was said to be
actually coming; <span class="sni">Arnulf goes to Ireland.</span>
Arnulf was sent, or went of his own
accord, to hasten the pace of these new allies, who, beside
such help as they might give to Robert, were to
bring Arnulf himself a wife who might one day give him
a crown. But as Arnulf took his own men with him,
Robert was yet further weakened by his going.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1144" id="fnanchor_1144"></a><a href="#footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a></span>
At this
moment one more chance seemed to offer itself. <span class="sni">Magnus in Anglesey.</span>
The
Norwegian King was once more afloat, and that for the
last time. His course was much the same as on his
former voyage. He sailed by the Orkneys and the
Sudereys to Man, and thence once more to Anglesey.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1145" id="fnanchor_1145"></a><a href="#footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a></span>
<span class="sni">His castle-building in Man.</span>
Here, we are told, he busied himself in cutting down
timber for the repair of certain castles in Man which he
had formerly destroyed. It must have been at this
<a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a><span class="pageno">443</span>
stage of the voyage of Magnus that Earl Robert sent a
message craving help at his hands. It must have cost
Robert somewhat of an effort to ask help of the slayer
of his brother, <span class="sni">Robert vainly asks help of Magnus.</span>
and, unless we attribute to the Norwegian
King a general interest in confusion everywhere, it is
hard to see on what ground Magnus could be expected
to help Robert of Bellême against King Henry. The
Northman refused all help. <span class="sni">Failure of the Irish scheme.</span>
It would seem too that the
Irish alliance came to nothing; one version at least
makes this the moment when the daughter of Murtagh
was given to Sigurd the son of Magnus, and not to
Arnulf of Montgomery.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1146" id="fnanchor_1146"></a><a href="#footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Robert of Bellême left alone.</span>
Every chance of help far and
near had failed the once mighty lord of so many lands
and castles; his old friends had turned against him; his
strivings to win new friends had failed. As far as England
was concerned, Earl Robert seemed to be left alone
on the mound of Shrewsbury.</p>

<p><span class="sni">Divisions in Bridgenorth;</span>
And yet for a moment one hope seemed left to him.
The message of the three captains which announced the
speedy surrender of Bridgenorth was premature. Roger,
Robert, and Wulfgar, had promised more than they
could do at the moment. There was a wide difference
of interest between two classes of men who stood side
by side on the height of Bridgenorth. <span class="sni">the captains and the townsmen for surrender;</span>
The captains and
the burgesses of the town&mdash;&#8203;for such a class had already
in the space of four years sprung up at the gate of Earl
Robert’s castle<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1147" id="fnanchor_1147"></a><a href="#footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;were of one mind, the mercenary soldiers
were of another. The three captains, the townsmen,
and doubtless any of the Earl’s soldiers of whatever
rank who were English by birth or settlement, any who
<a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a><span class="pageno">444</span>
had any stake on English soil, were eager to come to
terms with the King. So to do was their manifold interest
and manifest duty; it was a special interest and
duty of the captains who had promised so to do, and
who looked for such rich rewards for so doing. <span class="sni">the mercenaries wish to hold out.</span>
But to
the mercenary soldiers of Earl Robert, professional fighting
men picked out from many lands, things had another
look. They had no stake in England; they cared nothing
for King Henry and for the peace of his kingdom.
The more the peace of England was likely to be disturbed,
the better it would be for them. Any glimmering
of duty which found a place in their minds would
be a feeling of rude faithfulness to the master whom
they served, the rebel Earl whose bread they had eaten.
The mercenaries therefore cried out loudly against the
submission to which, without taking them into their
counsels, the captains and the townsmen had agreed.
They seized their arms, and strove to hinder the carrying
out of the surrender which had been promised.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1148" id="fnanchor_1148"></a><a href="#footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a></span>
<span class="sni">They are overpowered.</span>
But the
captains, with the townsmen and the loyal party in the
garrison, were too strong for them; they were themselves
made prisoners and shut up within some one part of the
castle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1149" id="fnanchor_1149"></a><a href="#footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Surrender of Bridgenorth.</span>
The surrender was now carried out; the gates
were opened; the royal troops marched up the path
which led to the castle, and the banner of England again
floated over the height crowned by the stronghold of
Æthelflæd.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1150" id="fnanchor_1150"></a><a href="#footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a></span>
The joy of the men of Bridgenorth was
great, and on that day of deliverance no man was inclined
to harshness. King Henry could honour the
faithfulness of the Earl’s mercenaries to their own lord,
even though that faithfulness was, in the eye of the law,
<a name="Page_445" id="Page_445"></a><span class="pageno">445</span>
treason to himself and his kingdom. <span class="sni">The mercenaries march out with the honours of war.</span>
They were allowed
to go forth with the honours of war, with their arms and
their horses. Whither they went we are not told. They
may even have entered the King’s service. The prudence
of Henry might be trusted not to let them go anywhither
where they were likely to be dangerous. And,
as they came forth between the ranks of the besiegers,
they were allowed to tell their tale in the hearing of all
men. It was not, they said, to be turned to the shame
of their calling that the Castle by the Bridge had been
given up without a blow. They were guiltless; the
deed was done by the guile of faithless captains and
of unwarlike townsmen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1151" id="fnanchor_1151"></a><a href="#footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a></span>
King and people might admire,
in truth there is something to admire, in the mistaken
faithfulness of these men, even to an evil cause.
But King and people had still work on their hands; the
arch-enemy had still to be found, alive or dead, in the
last stronghold which held out for him.</p>

<p class="p2">And now came the last act of the drama, the last
stage of the struggle which was to make Henry truly
king, and to give England three-and-thirty years of
peace under his rule. <span class="sni">Robert still holds Shrewsbury.</span> With the news of the fall of
Bridgenorth all hope passed away from the heart of Robert
of Bellême. One strong fortress indeed was still
his.
Earl of the Mercians, Earl of Shropshire, he could
call himself no longer; lord of Shrewsbury he still was,
while he still kept the castle of his capital as the last
abiding seat of rebellion. <span class="sni">Shrewsbury castle.</span>
All the distinctive features
<a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a><span class="pageno">446</span>
of Shrewsbury in later times, town, churches, castle,
abbey, were all there. On the neck of the peninsula
girded by the Severn, on ground high in itself though
lower than some points of the hill town behind it, the
mound of Old-English days which had supplanted the
old seat of British kingship, and which was now crowned
by the fortress of his father, still was his.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1152" id="fnanchor_1152"></a><a href="#footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a></span>
Its towers
rose as high as the loftiest buildings of the town which
they kept in awe; from their height he might look
forth on the mountain land which had been won for his
earldom by his father’s power; he might look down on
the broad and rushing river, and on his father’s minster
beyond its stream.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1153" id="fnanchor_1153"></a><a href="#footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a></span>
But the mountain land, so lately his
ally, had now turned against him; the stream of Severn
brought no help to the beleaguered fortress; no prayers,
we may be sure, went up for the son of Mabel from the
altars whose guardians had seen the virtues and tasted
the bounty of Adeliza. <span class="sni">Despair of Robert.</span>
The stern earl, thus utterly forsaken,
lost his fierce and defiant spirit; he groaned for
sorrow; he knew not which way to turn for help or
counsel.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1154" id="fnanchor_1154"></a><a href="#footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The King’s march to Shrewsbury.</span> And soon he felt that his hour indeed was
come, when he saw the royal banners draw near to his
last stronghold. As soon as Bridgenorth had fallen,
the march on Shrewsbury began. A mighty host it
was which set forth on the errand of deliverance. <span class="sni">Gathering of the English army.</span>
We
take the figures as merely the conventional expression
of a vast number, when we read that sixty thousand
Englishmen gathered around the standard of King Henry
<a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a><span class="pageno">447</span>
of England.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1155" id="fnanchor_1155"></a><a href="#footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Zeal of the troops.</span>
They marched with a will, eager to meet the
great oppressor face to face, to bring the last stronghold
of wrong under the dominion of law, to join in their
king’s work of rooting out the ungodly that were in the
land. Englishmen had gone forth with a will to the siege
of Rochester, perhaps to the siege of Bamburgh; but then
they had gone forth at the bidding of a king who was
wholly a stranger. Now they gathered around a king,
born indeed of the foreign stock, but a king of their own
choice, born on their own soil, cheering them on in their
own tongue, a king whom they might well deem a truer
Ætheling than the grandson of Ironside born in distant
Hungary or than the son of Harold brought up among
the wikings of the North. <span class="sni">Nature of the road.</span>
The road by which they had
to march was one which had dangers of its own. It was
a road among hills, sometimes rough with stones; in
one part it was for a mile’s space a mere hollow way,
overhung by a thick wood, a path so narrow that two
horses could hardly pass, a path which men called the
<em>Evil Hedge</em>. Among the trees on either side archers might
easily lurk, to the no small loss of the host which had to
march between two fires.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1156" id="fnanchor_1156"></a><a href="#footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a></span>
<span class="sni">The road is cleared.</span>
The King accordingly first
sent forward his pioneers to clear the way for his army
and for all travellers along that road for ever. The
wood was cut down on both sides, the path was widened,
and the evil hedge became a broad road along which the
great host of England could march in safety.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1157" id="fnanchor_1157"></a><a href="#footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a><span class="pageno">448</span>
Along the new-made road King Henry marched to a
bloodless conquest. He had no need to throw up a
bank or to shoot an arrow against the mound and
the towers of Shrewsbury. <span class="sni">Robert sends to ask for peace.</span>
On his way he was met by
an embassy from Earl Robert, asking for peace. The
terms are not told us, but the answer implied that
Robert still asked for terms. He may have hoped,
shut out as he was from everything else, still to
keep the capital of his earldom, perhaps as a means for
one day winning back all that he had lost. <span class="sni">The King refuses terms.</span>
But the
King and his host were in no mood to listen to terms;
they longed for the last attack on the arch-enemy. The
answer, the decree, as we read it, of the armed Gemót,
was that Robert of Bellême must hope for no mercy,
unless he came and freely threw himself into the King’s
hands.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1158" id="fnanchor_1158"></a><a href="#footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a></span>
In that case, it will be remembered, the King’s
word was pledged for his life and his safe passage to
Normandy. Robert consulted the few friends whom he
had left, and their advice at last bent his proud heart
to an unconditional submission. Nine days had passed
since the surrender of Bridgenorth<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1159" id="fnanchor_1159"></a><a href="#footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a></span>
when the royal force
drew near to Shrewsbury. <span class="sni">Robert submits at discretion.</span>
Robert of Bellême came
forth in person to meet them; he knelt, we may suppose,
before the King; he confessed his treason, and placed in
the King’s hands the keys of Shrewsbury, city and
castle. He thus gave up for ever his last English possession,
the head of that great earldom which his father had
received from the hands of the King’s father.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1160" id="fnanchor_1160"></a><a href="#footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a></span>
As far as
<a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"></a><span class="pageno">449</span>
England was concerned, the lord of Bellême, a moment
before lord of Shrewsbury, was a landless man. <span class="sni">He is sent out of England.</span>
The
King strictly kept his word to the suppliant; but he
would not grant him the slightest favour beyond what
his word bound him to. Robert was untouched in life
and limb, he received a safe-conduct to the sea-shore, and
he was allowed to keep his arms and horses, a needful
defence in case of irregular attack.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1161" id="fnanchor_1161"></a><a href="#footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a></span>
And so the land
was free from its worst enemy; the devil of Bellême was
cast out of the realm of England. Evil men no doubt
were left behind; but none, we may believe, who would
refuse to ransom his prisoners, for the mere pleasure of
seeing them die of hunger or of torture.</p>

<p>The work was done; the host of victorious Englishmen
marched back to their homes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1162" id="fnanchor_1162"></a><a href="#footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Joy at Robert’s overthrow.</span>
The joy of the land
at the great deliverance was beyond words. The tyrant
was overthrown, the King was now king indeed. The
national joy is set before us as bursting forth in a kind
of rhythmical song, which reminds us of those fragments
of primæval poetry which remain imbedded in
the history of the Hebrews. We hear the same strain
as that which denounced woe to Moab and rejoiced in
the undoing of the people of Chemosh,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1163" id="fnanchor_1163"></a><a href="#footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a></span>

<span class="sni">Banishment of Arnulf and Roger.</span>

<span class="sni">The King’s hatred towards the whole family.</span>
His hatred

Robert of Bellême
himself went over to Normandy, to raise new disturbances

knew whether he lived or died.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1166" id="fnanchor_1166"></a><a href="#footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a></span>

Was he an accomplice, was he a messenger,

Towards the
Welsh prince Jorwerth, who had done so much on both
sides in the course of the rebellion, Henry was, according
to the Welsh writers, far from keeping his word. <span class="sni">War between Jorwerth and his brothers.</span>
It is
not wonderful that enmity arose between Jorwerth and
his brothers after his conduct during the siege of
Bridgenorth. He seems to have waged open war
with them in the King’s name. <span class="sni">Meredydd imprisoned.</span>
For we are told that

<span class="sni">Jorwerth cedes Ceredigion to Cadwgan.</span>
But with Cadwgan he made peace, giving up to him
a large share of his promised dominions, namely the
lands which Cadwgan had before held of Robert of
Bellême, Ceredigion and part of Powys. It was perhaps
this agreement with an enemy which offended
Henry. <span class="sni">The King does not fulfil his promises to Jorwerth.</span>
When Jorwerth came, seemingly to receive his
grant from the King’s hands, he received nothing.
Dyfed and the castle of Pembroke, far too precious a
stronghold to be left in the hands of any Briton, was
entrusted to a knight named Saer, from whom it afterwards
passed to Gerald of Windsor, a man who had
already bravely defended it, and whom the King had
his own reasons for promoting.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1170" id="fnanchor_1170"></a><a href="#footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Grant of Gower and other lands to Howel.</span>
But the remainder

<span class="sni">Jorwerth tried at Shrewsbury and imprisoned. 1103.</span>
The next
year Jorwerth was summoned before an assembly at
Shrewsbury, the place renowned for the trial of a more
famous Welsh prince of later days. The choice of the
place is characteristic of the reign of Henry, <span class="sni">Gemóts held in various places under Henry.</span> under
whom national assemblies were held in various parts
of the kingdom, and were no longer confined to the
three places to which custom had confined them under
Eadward, Harold, and the two Williams.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1172" id="fnanchor_1172"></a><a href="#footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a></span>
<span class="sni">Shrewsbury a former place of meeting.</span>
It was but

but this was the first time that Shrewsbury in its new
form had seen a great national gathering; <span class="sni">The earldom of Shrewsbury.</span>
it was the first
assembly that had been held since the English mound
had become the kernel of Earl Roger’s castle, and since
Earl Roger’s abbey had arisen beyond the river. Earls
had now passed away from Shrewsbury; no such title
was heard again till the days of the famous Talbot, when
it was in French and not in English ears that the name
was terrible. After the four years’ rule of Robert of
Bellême, there was doubtless much to settle in his
former earldom and along the whole Welsh border. <span class="sni">Trial of Jorwerth.</span>
In

<p class="p2"><span class="sni">Establishment of Henry’s power.</span>
King Henry had at last done his work. When Robert
of Bellême was cast out, his throne remained safe and
his kingdom peaceful. Two years later indeed there
was another enemy to cast out; but the ease with which
the work was now done showed how thoroughly the
harder work had been done before Bridgenorth and
Shrewsbury. <span class="sni">Banishment of William of Mortain, 1104.</span>
When the King’s near kinsman and bitter
enemy, Count William of Mortain, would fain have had

there was no need of a siege of Pevensey or of Montacute.

He lived to try the chance of slash and blow at Tinchebrai, and

and sovereign.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1177" id="fnanchor_1177"></a><a href="#footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a></span>
His ambition could not disturb the
peace of the land for a single day; the might of armed
unlaw had been broken when the gates of Shrewsbury

opened to receive King Henry. <span class="sni">Peace of Henry’s reign. 1102&ndash;1135.</span>
From that day for
three-and-thirty years, a wonder in those days, a whole
kingdom saw neither civil war nor foreign invasion.
As Italy rested of old under Theodoric, as Sicily rested
under his contemporary Roger, so England rested under
Henry. <span class="sni">Henry and Roger of Sicily.</span>
The two Norman and insular kings, lords of the
great island of the Mediterranean and of the great island
of the Ocean, had each his wars to wage. But each kept
his battle-ground on the mainland, while his island
realm abode in peace. <span class="sni">Character of Henry’s reign.</span>
The bright promises with
which the reign of Henry opened, the dreams of an
English king reigning over an English people, were
not wholly fulfilled. <span class="sni">Its promises how far fulfilled.</span>
The fair dawn was in some
measure clouded over; the winning promises were not
in everything carried out. Still things were not under
Henry as they had been under his brother. The dawn
was never changed into the blackness of darkness; the
promises of righteous and national rule were never
utterly trampled under foot. Under the strong hand of
the Lion of Justice such deeds as those of Robert of Bellême
became impossible. The complaints of exactions
in money go on throughout his reign. The more
grievous complaints of the wrongs done by <a name="line454_13" id="line454_13"></a>his immediate
followers are not heard of after the stern statute
by which Henry and Anselm joined together to check
their misdoings. <span class="sni">The reign of law.</span>
Under Henry law did not always put
on a winning shape; but it was felt that the reign of
law in any shape was better than the reign of unlaw.
<span class="sni">Effects of Henry’s reign.</span>
It may be that the very restraint under which the
powers of evil were kept down during the reign of
Henry led to a fiercer outbreak when they were set
free at his death. <span class="sni">Henry the Second.</span>
But the same process had given
the nation life and strength to bear up through the
frightful years of anarchy, and to be ready at their
close to welcome another Henry again to do justice
<a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a><span class="pageno">455</span>
and make peace. <span class="sni">Fusion of Normans and English under Henry.</span>
But above all, the rule of Henry
wiped out the distinction which, at his accession,
had divided the conquerors and the conquered. Under
him Normans born on English ground grew up as
Englishmen. They felt as Englishmen, when the second
restoration of the reign of law brought with it, as its
dark side, the preference of men from beyond the sea
to the sons of the soil of either race. <span class="sni">Henry the refounder of the English nation.</span>
With all his
faults, his vices, his occasional crimes, Henry the Clerk,
the first of the new line who was truly an English
Ætheling, must rank before all other kings as the refounder
of the English nation. <span class="sni">He embodies the process of fusion.</span>
He is himself the
embodiment of the process by which the Norman on
English soil washed off the varnish of his two centuries’
sojourn by the Seine, and came back to his
true place in the older Teutonic fellowship of Angle,
Saxon, and Dane. When Henry gave back to his people
the laws of King Eadward with the amendments of
King William, he wrote in advance the whole later
history of England. The old stock was neither cut
down nor withered away; but a new stock was grafted
upon it. And it was no unworthy fruit that it bore in
the person of the King in whose days none durst misdo
with other.</p>

<p class="p2">With the firm establishment of Henry’s rule by the fall
of Robert of Bellême my immediate story ends. Of the
memorable time which followed, a time memorable for
many things, but memorable above all as being, within
the English kingdom, a perfect blank in military history,
I have sketched the outline in another volume. I
there traced out the leading features of the reign and
discussed its leading results. <span class="sni">The compromise with Anselm. 1107.</span>
I there traced the later
stages of the career of Anselm, his dispute with Henry,
his second departure and second restoration, the final
<a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a><span class="pageno">456</span>
compromise which to the wisdom of Henry and the
single-mindedness of Anselm was not impossible. <span class="sni">The war with Robert.</span>
I traced out also the various matters in dispute between
Henry and Robert till the time when, as men fondly
deemed, England, after forty years, paid back the day of
Senlac on the day of Tinchebrai. <span class="sni">1106.</span>
I could have been
well pleased to carry on in detail to their end two
stories of which I have had to tell so large a part. But
my immediate subject ends when King Henry is made
fast on his throne by the overthrow of the rebel Earl of
Shrewsbury. Earlier than that point the tale could not
stop. <span class="sni">The reign of Rufus how far an episode.</span>
Deep as is the importance of the reign of William
Rufus in so many ways, there is a certain way of looking
at things in which the reign of William Rufus is a kind
of episode. Or rather it is an attempt at a certain
object which, when tried in the person of Rufus, failed,
and which had to be again tried, with better luck, in
the person of Henry. <span class="sni">Problem of reconciling England to the Conquest.</span>
The problem was to reconcile the
English nation to the Norman Conquest, to nationalize,
so to speak, the Conquest and the dynasty which the
Conquest had brought in. The means thereto was to
find a prince of the foreign stock who should reign as an
English king, with the good will of the English people, in
the interest of the English people. <span class="sni">Not solved under Rufus,</span>
William Rufus might
have held that place, if he had been morally capable of
it. His crown was won for him from Norman rebels
by the valour and loyalty of Englishmen, when for the
last time they met Normans on their own soil as enemies.
But Rufus forsook his trust; he belied his promises; if
he did not strictly become an oppressor of Englishmen
as Englishmen, it was only because he became the
common oppressor and enemy of mankind. <span class="sni">but solved by Henry.</span>
Thirteen
years later the same drama was acted over again.
Henry, who reigned by a more direct choice of the
English people than William, owed his crown also to
<a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a><span class="pageno">457</span>
the loyalty of Englishmen whose valour against Norman
enemies it was found needless to test in the open field.
This time the problem was solved; if Henry did not
bring back the days of Ælfred or even the days of
Cnut, he at least brought in a very different state of
things from what men had seen in the days of his
brother. <span class="sni">England no longer a conquered land.</span>
After the election at Winchester, the conference
at Alton, the fight at Tinchebrai, England could
no longer be called a conquered land. The work of the Norman Conquest was from one side confirmed for ever,
from another side it was undone for ever. <span class="sni">The Conquest at once confirmed and undone.</span>
The last act of the struggle, an afterpiece more stirring than the main
drama, was when Robert of Bellême came forth, shorn
of his power to do evil, to surrender the stronghold of
Shrewsbury to his sovereign. The surrender of Chester
to the elder William marked that the first struggle was
over, and that the Norman was to rule in England. <span class="sni">Import of the surrender of Shrewsbury.</span>
The
surrender of Shrewsbury to his youngest son marked
that the second struggle was over, the struggle which
ruled that, though the Norman was to reign in England,
he was to reign only by putting on the character of an
English king, called to his throne by the voice of
Englishmen, and guarded there by their loyalty against
the plots and assaults of Norman rebels.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Accession of William Rufus.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> remarkable thing about the accession of William Rufus is
that it is the one case in those days in which a king succeeds without
any trace of regular election, whether by the nation at large
or by any smaller body. The ecclesiastical election which formed
part of the rite of coronation was doubtless not forgotten; but there
is no sign of any earlier election by the Witan, or by any gathering
which could call itself by their name. Lanfranc appears as the
sole actor. One account, the Life of Lanfranc attached to the
Winchester Chronicle, speaks of the archbishop in so many words
as the one elector; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Mortuo rege Willielmo trans mare, filium ejus
Willielmum, sicut pater constituit, <em>Lanfrancus regem elegit</em>, et
in ecclesia beati Petri, in occidentali parte Lundoniæ sita, sacravit
et coronavit.”</span> The words of Eadmer (<abbr title="Historia novorum">Hist. Nov.</abbr> 13) are almost
equally strong;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Defuncto itaque rege Willielmo, successit ei in regnum, Willielmus
filius ejus, qui cum regni fastigia fratri suo Roberto
præripere gestiret, et Lanfrancum, <em>sine cujus accensu in regnum
ascisci nullatenus poterat</em>, sibi in hoc ad expletionem desiderii sui
<em>non omnino consentaneum</em> inveniret, verens ne dilatio suæ consecrationis
inferret ei dispendium cupiti honoris,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>William of Malmesbury too (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 305) goes so far as to say;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“A patre, ultima valetudine decumbente, in successorem adoptatus,
antequam ille extremum efflasset, ad occupandum regnum contendit,
moxque <em>volentibus animis provincialium exceptus</em>, et claves
<a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a><span class="pageno">460</span>
thesaurorum nactus est, quibus fretus totam Angliam animo
subjecit suo. Accessit etiam favori ejus, <em>maximum rerum momentum</em>,
archiepiscopus Lanfrancus, eo quod eum nutrierat et
militem fecerat, quo auctore et annitente,… coronatus,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Neither of these writers follows any strict order of time. The
willing assent of the people may mean either their passive assent
at his coming, or their more formal assent on the coronation-day.
The general good-will shown towards the new king is set forth
also by Robert of Torigny (Cont. Will. Gem. <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 2; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“susceptus
est ab Anglis et Francis”</span>), by the author of the Brevis Relatio
(11) in the same words, and by the Battle writer (39); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“omnium
favore, ut decebat, magnifice exceptus.”</span></p>

<p>If then we accept Eadmer’s words in their fulness, the only
objection made at the time to Rufus’ accession came from his
special elector, Lanfranc himself. This incidental notice, implying
that Lanfranc did hesitate, is very remarkable. We are not told
the ground of his objections. But of whatever kind they were,
they were overcome by the new King’s special oath, in which the
formal words of the coronation bond seem to be mixed up with
oaths and promises of a more general kind;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cœpit, tam per se tam per omnes suos quos poterat, fide sacramentoque
Lanfranco promittere justitiam, æquitatem, et misericordiam,
se per totum regnum, si rex foret, in omni negotio servaturum;
pacem, libertatem, securitatem, ecclesiarum contra omnes
defensurum, necne præceptis atque consiliis ejus per omnia et in
omnibus obtemperaturum.”</p>

<p>We may compare the special promise of Æthelred on his restoration
(<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume one page">N. C. vol. i. p.</abbr> 368) to follow the advice of his Witan in all things.</p>

<p class="p2">The first signs of any thought of usurpation or the like in the
accession of Rufus may be dimly seen in the Hyde writer (298);
where however stronger phrases are, oddly enough, applied to
Robert;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Defuncto rege Willelmo et sepulturæ tradito, Willelmus filius
ejus in Angliam transvectus regnum <em>occupat, regemque se vocari
omnibus imperat</em>; Robertus quoque frater ejus regressus a Gallia,
Normanniam <em>invadit</em>, et nullo resistente ditioni suæ supponit.”</p>

<p>By the time of William of Newburgh men had found out the
hereditary right of the eldest son. He says, first (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 2), that Robert
<a name="Page_461" id="Page_461"></a><span class="pageno">461</span>
succeeded in Normandy, William in England, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ordine quidem præpostero,
sed per ultimam patris, ut dictum est, voluntatem commutato.”</span>
Directly after, the rebels of next year favour Robert,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“tanquam justo hæredi et perperam exhæredato”</span> (<abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> Suger,
Duchèsne, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 283, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Exhæredato majore natu Roberto fratre suo”</span>).
And presently, we hear of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“frater senior Robertus, cui nimirum
ordine naturali regni successio competebat.”</span> All this is odd, when
we remember how well in the next chapter (see <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 11) the
same author understands the position of Henry, as the only true
Ætheling, son of a king. Oddly enough, Thomas Wykes (<abbr title="Annales monastici four">Ann.
Mon. iv.</abbr> 11) gives this last position to Rufus, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quem primum
genuit [Willelmus le Bastard, rex Angliæ] postquam regnum
adquisivit.”</span></p>

<p>Matthew Paris (<abbr title="Historia Anglorum one">Hist. Angl. i.</abbr> 34, 35), as usual, gives the story
a colouring of his own, which may be compared with his version
of the accession of Henry the First (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page ">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 845). He has
told us that the Conqueror, in bequeathing his kingdom to his
second son, gave him special advice as to its rule;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmo Rufo filio suo Angliam, scilicet conquestum suum,
assignavit; supplicans ut Anglos, quos crudeliter et veluti ingratus
male tractaverat, mitius confoveret.”</p>

<p>He crosses to England, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“utilius reputans regnum sibi firmare
vivorum quam mortui cujuscumque exsequiis interesse.”</span> Then
we read;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmus, cognomento Rufus, filius regis Willelmi primi,
veniens in Angliam, consilio et auxilio Lamfranci Cantuariensis
archiepiscopi, qui ipsum a primis annis nutriverat et militem fecerat,
sine moroso dispendio Angliam sibi conciliatam inclinavit,
nec tamen totam. Sed ut negotium regis optatum cito sortiretur
effectum, ipsum die sanctorum Cosmæ et Damiani, <em>etsi cum sollemnitate
mutilata</em>, coronavit, veraciter promittentem ut Angliam
cum modestia gubernaret, leges sancti regis Edwardi servaturus,
et Anglos præcipue tractaret reverenter.”</p>

<p>These remarkable words must be taken in connexion with what
immediately follows, which is in truth a very rose-coloured version
of the rebellion of 1088, which is made immediately to follow, or
rather to accompany, the coronation. For the next words are;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Verumtamen quamplures Anglorum nobiles, formidantes et
augurantes ipsum velle patrissare, noluerunt ei obsecundare, sed
<a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a><span class="pageno">462</span>
elegerunt potius Roberto, militi strenuissimo, militare, et tamquam
primogenito ipsi in regem creato famulari, quam fallacibus promissis
Rufi fidem adhibere. Sed Lamfrancus hæc sedavit, bona
promittens.”</p>

<p>Still the new King sees that many of the nobles of the kingdom
are plotting against him. By the advice of Lanfranc therefore he
gathers a secret assembly of English nobles (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Anglorum nobiliores
et fortiores invitando secretius convocavit”</span>); he promises with an
oath on the Gospels to give them good laws and all the old free
customs (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pristinae libertatis consuetudines”</span>). He then wins over
Roger of Montgomery, according to the account in <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 61.
Then, again by Lanfranc’s advice, he divides and weakens the English
by his promises (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“omnes Anglos, quos insuperabiles, si fuissent
inseparabiles, cognoverat, talibus sermocinationibus et promissis dissipatos
et enervatos sibi conciliavit”</span>). A few only resist; against
those he wages a successful war at the head of the nation generally
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“eorum conamina, universitatis adjutus viribus, quantocius annullavit”</span>),
and confiscates their goods.</p>

<p>It is clear that Matthew Paris had the elder writers before him,
but that he did not fully understand their language with regard
to the appeal of Rufus to the English. We must remember the
time when he wrote. In his day the immediate consequences of
the Conquest had passed away; the distinction of “Angli” and
“Franci,” so living in the days of Rufus, was forgotten. But men
had not yet begun to speculate about “Normans and Saxons,” as
Robert of Gloucester did somewhat later. Moreover Matthew was
used to a state of things in which a king who, if not foreign by
birth, was foreign in feeling, had to be withstood by an united
English nation, indifferent as to the remoter pedigree of each man.
He therefore told the story of the reign of Rufus as if it had been
the story of the reign of Henry the Third. All are “Angli;” the
distinction drawn by the Chronicler between the “French” who
rebelled against the King and the “English” to whom he appealed,
is lost. The English people whom he called to his help against the
Norman nobles become English nobles whom he cunningly wins
over in secret. Matthew understands that England was a conquered
country with a foreign king; he does not understand the
relations of foreigners and natives in the island, and that the foreign
king appealed to the natives against his own countrymen. The
<a name="Page_463" id="Page_463"></a><span class="pageno">463</span>
passage is most valuable, not as telling us anything about the reign
of William Rufus, but as showing us how the reign of William
Rufus looked when read by the present experience of the reign of
Henry the Third.</p>

<p>At the same time Matthew Paris must have had something
special in his eye, when he spoke of the coronation rites of William
Rufus as being in some way imperfect. Was there any tradition
that, as John did not communicate at his coronation, so neither did
William? Men may have argued from one tyrant to another.</p>

<p>On the whole we may say that William Rufus, like Servius
Tullius (<abbr title="Cicero De Republica two">Cic. de Rep. ii.</abbr> 21), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“regnare coepit, non jussu, sed voluntate
atque concessu civium.”</span></p>

<p class="p2">Besides these accounts, given by contemporary or nearly contemporary
writers, or founded on their statements, there is
another version of William’s accession, which I take to be
wholly mythical. This is preserved in the local history of Colchester
abbey (Monasticon, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 607). In this the accession of
Rufus is said to have been almost wholly brought about by
Eudo the <em>dapifer</em>, the son of Hubert of Rye. It seems to be a
continuation of another legend (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume three page">N. C. vol. iii. p.</abbr> 683), in which
Hubert is made the chief actor in the bequest of the crown which
Eadward is said to have made in favour of the elder William. It
is in short a family legend, devised in honour of the house of Rye.
The same part is played in two successive generations; the father
secures the crown for the elder William, the son for the younger.
First of all, we are told of the way in which Eudo gained his office
of <em>dapifer</em>, an office which the witness of Domesday shows that he
really held. The story is almost too silly to tell; but it runs thus.
William Fitz-Osbern, before he set out to seek for crowns in
Flanders, held the post of “major domus regiæ.” In that character
he was setting a dish of crane’s flesh before William, and,
as it was ill-cooked (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“carnem gruis semicrudæ adeo ut sanguis exprimeretur”</span>),
the King aimed a blow at him. Eudo, as though he
had been Lilla saving Eadwine from the poisoned dagger of Eomer,
thrust himself forward and received the blow which was meant for
the Earl of Hereford. William Fitz-Osbern accordingly resigns
his office, asking that Eudo may succeed him in it. We hear
no more till William’s death, when Eudo appears as exhorting
<a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a><span class="pageno">464</span>
William Rufus to hasten and take possession of the English crown
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eudo, arrepta occasione ex paterna concessione, Willelmum
juniorem aggreditur, et ut negotio insistat hortatur”</span>). They cross
over together, and are made to land at <em>Worcester</em>&mdash;<em>Portchester</em> must
be meant, through some confusion of <em>p</em> and ƿ. Thence they go
to Winchester, and get the keys of the treasure-house by favour
of its keeper, William of Pont de l’Arche, a person whom I
cannot find in Domesday (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In Angliam transvecti, appliciti
<em>Worcestriæ</em> comparato sibi favore Willielmi de Ponte-arce, claves
thesauri Wintoniæ suscipiunt quarum idem Willielmus custos
erat”</span>). Not only the coming of the younger William, but
the death of the elder, is carefully kept secret, while Eudo
goes to Dover, Pevensey, Hastings, and the other fortresses
on the coast. Pretending orders from the King, he binds their
garrisons by oaths to give up the keys to no one except by his
orders (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“fide et sacramento custodes obligat nemini nisi suo arbitrio
claves munitionis tradituros … prætendens regem in Normannia
moras facturum, et velle de omnibus munitionibus Angliæ
securitatem habere, per se scilicet qui senescallus erat”</span>). He then
comes back to Winchester; the death of the King is announced,
and, while the peers of the realm are in Normandy debating about
the succession to the crown, William Rufus is, through the diligence
of Eudo, elected and crowned (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“acceleratoque negotio, Wintoniam
redit; et tunc demum regem obiisse propalat. Ita dum
cæteri proceres de regni successione tractant in Normannia, interim
studio et opera Eudonis, Willielmus junior in regem eligitur, consecratur,
confirmatur, in Anglia”</span>). The story goes on to say that
the people of Colchester petitioned the new King that they might
be put under the care of Eudo. To this William gladly agreed, and
Eudo ruled the town with great justice and mercy, relieving the
inhabitants from their heavy burthens, seemingly by the process of
taking to himself a large amount of confiscated land and paying
the taxes laid upon the town out of it (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“causas cœpit inquirere,
sublevare gravatos, comprimere elatos, et in suis primordiis omnibus
complacere. Terras damnatorum, exlegatorum, et pro culpis
eliminatorum, dum nemo coleret, exigebantur tamen plenaliter
fiscalia, et hac de causa populus valde gravabatur. Has ergo
terras Eudo sibi vindicavit, ut pro his fisco satisfaceret et populum
eatenus alleviaret”</span>).</p>

<p><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465"></a><span class="pageno">465</span>
The share taken by Eudo in the accession of William seems to be
pure fiction. His good deeds at Colchester are perfectly possible;
but the latter part of the story seems to be a confusion or perversion
of an entry in Domesday (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 106), which rather reads as
if Eudo had become possessor, and that in the time of the elder
William, of the common land of the burgesses (“Eudo dapifer <abbr title="5">v.</abbr>
denarios et <abbr title="40">xl.</abbr> acras terræ quas tenebant burgenses tempore R. E.
et reddebant omnem consuetudinem burgensium. Modo vero non
reddunt consuetudinem nisi de suis capitibus”). This looks as

<p class="center sc">The beginning of the Rebellion of 1088.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Of</span> the great revolt of the Normans in England against William
Rufus we have three accounts in considerable detail, in the
Chronicle, in Florence, and in Orderic. The Chronicle and
Florence do not follow exactly the same arrangement, but I do
not see any contradiction between them. Florence simply arranges
his narrative in such a way as to give special prominence to his
own city and his own bishop. But Orderic, from whom we get
a most vivid, and seemingly quite trustworthy, account of certain
parts of the campaign, seems to have misconceived the order of
events in the early part of the story, especially with regard to
the time of Bishop Odo’s coming to England. According to him,
Odo did not come to England till after Christmas. He then comes,
along with Eustace of Boulogne and Robert of Bellême, as the
agent of a plot already devised in concert with Duke Robert for
the death or deposition of his brother. The others join them, and
the rebellion begins.</p>

<p>In the other version, that of the Chronicle and Florence,
illustrated in various points of detail by William of Malmesbury,
Henry of Huntingdon, and other writers, Odo comes to England
much sooner, in time for the Christmas assembly. He brings no
treasonable intentions with him; he takes to plotting only when
<a name="Page_466" id="Page_466"></a><span class="pageno">466</span>
he finds that his power in England is less than he had hoped that
it would be. Eustace and Robert of Bellême do not come to
England till a later stage, when the rebellion has fully broken
out, and when Odo is holding Rochester against the King. They
are then sent by Duke Robert, who is represented (see <a href="#Page_56"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 56</a>) as
hearing for the first time of the revolt in his favour after Rochester
was seized by Odo.</p>

<p>Orderic begins his story (665 D) with an account of seditious
meetings held by the nobles of Normandy and England, and of
speeches made at them. It is not said where they were spoken or
by whom, but the context would seem to imply that they were
spoken by Odo in Normandy. For immediately after the speech
follow the words (666 C);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hoc itaque consilium Odo præsul Baiocensis et Eustachius
comes Boloniensis atque Robertus Belesmensis aliique plures
communiter decreverunt, decretumque suum Roberto duci detexerunt.”</p>

<p>Then the consent of Robert is given, as in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 56, and the three
ringleaders cross to England, and begin the revolt;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Igitur post natale Domini prædicti proceres in Angliam transfretaverunt,
et castella sua plurimo apparatu muniverunt, multamque
partem patriæ contra regem infra breve tempus commoverunt.”</p>

<p>I have ventured (in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 25) to work the substance of the speech
into the text, as it contains arguments which suit the circumstances
of the case, and which are specially suited to speakers in Normandy.
But the speech cannot really have been spoken by Odo in Normandy.
For it is impossible to resist the evidence which brings
Odo over to England before the Christmas Assembly, and which
makes his enmity to the King arise out of things which happened
after he came to England. We have, first, the direct statement
(see <a href="#Page_19"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 19</a>) of Henry of Huntingdon that Odo was present at the
Christmas Gemót. And this statement is the more valuable,
because it is not brought in as part of the story of Odo; it reads
rather as if it came from some official source, perhaps from a list
of signatures to some act of the Assembly. But the words of
William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 306) come almost to the same thing;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cum ille, solutus a vinculis, Robertum nepotem in comitatu
Normanniæ confirmasset, Angliam venit, recepitque a rege comitatum
Cantiæ.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467"></a><span class="pageno">467</span>
The Midwinter Gemót was the obvious time for such a grant,
and Odo’s restoration to his earldom is asserted or implied everywhere.
Thus in the Chronicle we read a little later how <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Odo …
ferde into Cent to his eorldome,”</span> and Florence speaks of him as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Odo episcopus Baiocensis, qui et erat comes Cantwariensis.”</span>
Orderic himself (666 C) says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Odo, ut supra dictum est, palatinus
Cantiæ consul erat, et plures sub se comites virosque potentes
habebat,”</span> seemingly without seeing that his version hardly gives
any opportunity for the restoration of the earldom. Henry of
Huntingdon (214 Arnold), almost alone, speaks of him as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“princeps
et moderator Angliæ,”</span> without reference to his special office of
earl. William of Malmesbury goes on (see <a href="#Page_23"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 23</a>) to give the reason
for Odo’s discontent, the greater authority of the Bishop of Durham.
The Chronicle and Florence (see <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 23, 24) mention only the great
authority enjoyed by Bishop William, and the revolt of Odo, without
mentioning Odo’s motive. That is, they simply state the facts,
while William of Malmesbury supplies the connecting link. If we
accept Orderic’s version that Odo did not come to England till after
Christmas, we have hardly time for the events as they are stated
in our other authorities. For we have to find time for Odo’s re-establishment
in his earldom, for his hopes and for his disappointment,
all leading up to the seditious gatherings during Lent. And
in some parts of the kingdom, as we shall see in the next Note,
these gatherings took the form of an open outbreak somewhat
earlier than we should have been led to think from the account in
the Chronicle.</p>

<p>Now there can be no doubt as to the truth of the version
in which the Chronicle, Florence, and William of Malmesbury
substantially agree. All that Orderic has done has been to place
the voyage of Odo to England at a wrong time, and it is easy
to see how the mistake arose. He makes Odo, Eustace, and
Robert of Bellême cross together soon after Christmas. Now
it is quite clear that Eustace and Robert did not come to England
till after the rebellion had fully broken out, when Odo was holding
Rochester against the King. The Chronicle simply says (see
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 57) that they were at Rochester with Odo. Florence (see <a href="#Page_56"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 56</a>)
tells us more fully how they came to be there, namely, because they
had been sent by Robert in answer to Odo’s request. Nothing was
more easy than for Orderic to mistake this for a crossing in company
<a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"></a><span class="pageno">468</span>
with Odo. In his version, Odo, Eustace, and Robert, all cross
with a commission from Duke Robert. In the true version Odo
crosses long before to receive his English earldom, but with no
purpose of disturbing the new settlement of England. He becomes
discontented on English ground; he rebels, he asks help of Duke
Robert, and Eustace and Robert of Bellême come in answer to
his asking.</p>

<p>The Hyde writer, as usual, has a version of his own, which
however, as far as Odo is concerned, follows that of Orderic. As
soon as Robert has taken possession of his duchy, he calls a
council, and sends over an army under his two uncles Bishop Odo
and Count Robert, to take away the English crown from his
brother. They cross the sea, winning a naval victory over a pirate
fleet; they seize Rochester and Pevensey, and begin the rebellion
seemingly before the end of the year 1087. This account (298)
runs thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Robertus … convocatis principibus et consilio habito, duos
avunculos suos, comitem Moritanii et episcopum Baiocensem, cum
valida manu transmittit, omnimodis decertatis <em>Waltero</em> [sic] fratri
regnum auferre sibique conferre. Qui vela ventis committentes, et
cum piratis obsistentibus in mari viriliter decertantes, Angliam
veniunt, urbemque Roffensem et castellum Pevenesellum intrantes,
rebellare contendunt.”</p>

<p>We easily see from the later history of the rebellion how this
writer has taken some of its most striking incidents and, as
it were, crushed them up together. As Orderic confounds the
crossing of Odo with the crossing of Eustace and Robert of Bellême,
so the Hyde writer seems to confound both with the later expedition
from Normandy (see <a href="#Page_74"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 74</a>), which did not occupy Pevensey
after a victory, but was driven back by the King’s English troops
in an attempt to land at Pevensey.</p>

<p>The account given incidentally by Robert of Torigny (Cont.
Will. Gem. <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 3) has points in common with this version, though
it may be more easily reconciled with the true story. He records
the peace between William and Robert in 1091, and adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Licet regnum Angliæ ipse Robertus facillime paullo ante
potuisset habere, nisi minus cautus esset. Siquidem Eustachius
comes Boloniæ, et episcopus Baiocensis et comes Moritolii patrui
ejus, et alii principes Normanniæ, cum magno apparatu militum
<a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"></a><span class="pageno">469</span>
mare transeuntes, Rovecestriam et alia nonnulla castella in comitatu
Cantuariensi occupantes et tenentes ad opus illius, dum ipsum
Robertum ducem exspectant, qui tunc temporis ultra quam virum
deceat in Normannia deliciabatur, obsessi diu a rege Willelmo,
dum ille cujus causa tantum discrimen subierant, non subvenit,
cum dedecore ipsas quas tenebant munitiones exeuntes ad propria
sunt reversi.”</p>

<p>As for the object of the rebellion, the transfer of the English
crown from William to Robert, we may hear William of Newburgh,
who, though he believes (see above, <a href="#Page_461"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 461</a>) in Robert’s right
of succession, yet says that he <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in minori administratione, scilicet
ducatus Normannici, claruit quod regno amplissimo administrando
nunquam idoneus fuerit.”</span></p>

<p class="p2">What could <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> de Rémusat (Anselme, 113) have meant when
he said that the revolt of the Norman nobles <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“força le roi à se
rapprocher de ses sujets <em>bretons</em>”</span>? Then <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“il fit appel à la noblesse
indigène.”</span> This last may come from Matthew Paris; but the
Welsh, the nearest approach to Bretons, joined the rebels.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Share of Bishop William of Saint-Calais in the
Rebellion of 1088.</p>

<p><span class="sc">There</span> are few more glaring contradictions to be found in history
than the picture of Bishop William of Saint-Calais as drawn by the
southern writers, and his picture as drawn by his own hand or that
of some local admirer in the Durham document printed in the
Monasticon, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 245, and in the old edition of Simeon. No one
would know the meek confessor of this last version in the traitor
whom the Chronicler does not shrink from likening to the blackest
of all traitors. Yet, if the narratives are carefully compared, it may
seem that, with all the difference in colouring, there is much less contradiction
in matter of fact than we are led to think at first sight.
The opposition is simply of that kind which follows when each side,
without asserting any direct falsehood, leaves out all that tells on
behalf of the other side. We read the Bishop’s story; we see no
<a name="Page_470" id="Page_470"></a><span class="pageno">470</span>
reason to suspect him of stating anything which did not happen;
under the circumstances indeed he could hardly venture to state
anything which did not happen. But we see that the statement,
though doubtless true as a mere record of facts, is dressed up in a
most ingenious way, so as to put everything in the best light for his
side, while everything that was to be said on the other side is carefully
left out. But, on the other hand, while the Chronicler, Florence,
and William of Malmesbury, clearly leave out a great deal, there is
no reason to think that they leave it out from any partisan wish
to pervert the truth. They believed, and doubtless on good grounds,
that the Bishop of Durham was a chief actor in the rebellion, and
they said so. But there was nothing to lead them to dwell on his
story at any special length. Their attention was chiefly drawn to
other parts of the events of that stirring year. Orderic indeed,
whose account of some parts of the story is so minute, does not
speak of Durham or its bishop at all.</p>

<p>Some of the passages from the Chronicle have been quoted
in the text. The Bishop of Durham is there mentioned three
times. First comes the record of his influence with the King,
and his treason against him;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On þisum ræde wæs ærest Oda bisceop and Gosfrið bisceop
and Willelm bisceop on Dunholme. Swa wæll dyde se cyng be þam
bisceop þæt eall Englaland færde æfter his ræde, and swa swa he
wolde, and he þohte to donne be him eall swa Iudas Scarioð dide
be ure Drihtene.”</p>

<p>Then, after the account of the deliverance of Worcester, Bishop
William is named at the head of the ravagers in different parts of
the country; “Se bisceop of Dunholme dyde to hearme þæt he mihte
ofer eall be norðan.”</p>

<p>Lastly, at the end of the whole story, when Odo has come out
of Rochester and gone beyond sea, we read;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Se cyng siððan sende here to Dunholme, and let besittan þone
castel, and se bisceop griðode and ageaf þone castel, and forlet his
biscoprice and ferde to Normandige.”</p>

<p>Florence, writing seemingly with the Chronicle before him, changes
the story so far as to make, not Bishop William but Count Robert
(see <a href="#Page_33"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 33</a>), the chief accomplice of Odo. He then gives the list
of the other confederates, at the end of which, after Robert of
Mowbray, Bishop Geoffrey, and Earl Roger, we read, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quod erat</span>
<a name="Page_471" id="Page_471"></a><span class="pageno">471</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pejus, Willelmus episcopus Dunholmensis,”</span> followed by the passage
(see <a href="#Page_23"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 23</a>) in which he describes the Bishop’s influence with the
King. After this, he says nothing more about him till he records
his death in 1096.</p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon (215), also writing with the Chronicle
before him, leaves out the first passage of the three and translates
the two others. The third stands in his text;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Mittens rex exercitum Dunhelmiæ obsedit urbem, donec reddita
est ei. Episcopus vero multique proditorum propulsi sunt in
exilium.”</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury, in the Gesta Regum (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 306), first
mentions the influence of Bishop William and the envy which Odo
felt at it. Then, in reckoning up the Conspirators, he adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quinetiam Willelmus Dunelmensis episcopus, quem rex a
secretis habuerat, in eorum perfidiam concesserat; quod graviter
regem tulisse ferunt, quia, cum amissæ charitatis dispendio, remotarum
provinciarum frustrabatur compendio.”</p>

<p>At the end of the story, after Odo is gone, he adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dunelmensis episcopus ultro mare transivit, quem rex, verecundia
præteritæ amicitiæ, indemnem passus est effugere. Cæteri
omnes in fidem recepti.”</p>

<p>In the Gesta Pontificum (272) he introduces Bishop William as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“potens in sæculo,”</span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“oris volubilitate promptus, maxime sub
Willelmo rege juniore.”</span> This almost sounds as if he had read the
debates at the bishop’s own trial, but it is more likely that he had
his dealings with Anselm before his mind. He then goes on;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quapropter, et amicorum cohorti additus, et Angliæ prælatus,
non permansit in gratia. Quippe nullis principis dictis vel factis
contra eum extantibus, ab amicitia descivit, in perfidia Odonis Baiocensis
et ceterorum se immiscens. Quapropter, victis partibus,
ab Anglia fugatus, post duos annos indulgentia principis rediit.”</p>

<p>Simeon of Durham, in his History (1088, at the end of the year),
says simply, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Etiam Dunholmensis episcopus Willielmus <abbr title="7">vii.</abbr> anno
sui episcopatus, et multi alii de Anglia exierunt.”</span> This omission is
the more to be noticed, as he clearly had Florence and the Chronicle
before him. In the History of the Church of Durham (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 8) we
get a fuller account;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hujus [Willielmi regis], sicut et antea patris, amicitiis antistes
præfatus adjunctus, familiariter ei ad tempus adhærebat: unde
<a name="Page_472" id="Page_472"></a><span class="pageno">472</span>
etiam Alvertoniam cum suis appenditiis rex illi donavit. Post non
multum vero temporis, <em>per aliorum machinamenta orta inter ipsos
dissensione</em>, episcopus ab episcopatu pulsus ultra mare secessit, quem
comes Normannorum, non ut exulem, sed ut patrem suscipiens, in
magno honore per tres annos quibus ibi moratus est, habuit.”</p>

<p>In these accounts almost the only direct contradiction as to
matters of fact comes in at the end, about the surrender of the
castle of Durham to the King. The Chronicle certainly seems to
imply a siege; and, reading the Chronicle only without reference
to anything else, we should have thought that the Bishop himself
was besieged there. William of Malmesbury, on the other hand,
makes the story wind up between the King and the Bishop in a
wonderfully friendly way. But on this point we can have little
doubt in accepting the version which I have followed in the text
(see <a href="#Page_114"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 114</a>), namely that the Bishop was not at Durham, that the
castle was surrendered after a good deal of haggling, and perhaps
a little plundering, on both sides, but with nothing that could
be called a regular siege. In short, the Chronicler makes a little
too much of the fact that the castle was surrendered to a military
force. William of Malmesbury, on the other hand, makes
a little too much of the fact that the Bishop was not, strictly
speaking, driven from England by a judicial sentence, but that he
rather went by virtue of a proposal of his own making. The only
other question of strict fact which could be raised is as to the
ravages which the Chronicler says were wrought by the Bishop.
The picture in William of Malmesbury of the Bishop turning
against the King without any provocation on his part, and the
picture in the History of the Church of Durham of the men who
stirred up strife between the King and the Bishop, are merely the
necessary colouring from opposite sides. The only important point
on this head is that the disposition to make the best of the Bishop’s
conduct seems to have been general at Durham, and that it is not
confined to the narrative which must have been written either by
himself or under his immediate inspiration. But we must remember
that the general career of William of Saint-Calais at Durham, his
bringing in of monks and his splendid works of building, were sure
to make him pass into the list of local worthies, so that local
writers, both at the time and afterwards, would be led to make
the best of his conduct in any matter.
<a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a><span class="pageno">473</span></p>

<p>Of the Bishop’s own story, or at least the story of some local
writer who told it as the Bishop wished it to be told, I have given
the substance in the text. And, as its examination does not involve
any very great amount of comparison of one statement with
another, I have given the most important illustrative passages in
the form of notes to the text. I have said that, after all, there is
little real contradiction in direct statements of fact between this version
and that of the southern writers. We find the kind of differences
which are sure to be found when we have on one side a general
narrative, written without any special purpose, a narrative doubtless
essentially true, but putting in or leaving out details almost at random,
while we have on the other side a very minute and ingenious
apology, enlarging on all points on which it was convenient to enlarge,
and leaving out those which might tell the other way. But the truth
is that the Bishop’s own statement of his services done to the King
(see <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 29, 111), and the charge which was formally brought against
him by the King (see <a href="#Page_98"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 98</a>), do not really contradict one another.
They may be read as a consecutive story, according to which the
Bishop continued to be the King’s adviser, and to do him good outward
service, after he had made up his mind to join the rebels and
while he was waiting for an opportunity of so doing. It is most likely
this special double-dealing which led the Chronicler to his exceptionally
strong language with regard to the Bishop’s treason. The
only point where there seems any kind of contradiction in fact is
with regard to the dates. From the Chronicler and the other writers
on the King’s side we should have thought that there was no open
revolt anywhere till after Easter, whereas it is plain from the
Durham story that a great deal must have happened in south-eastern
England much earlier in the year. On this point the
Durham version, a version founded on documents and minutely
attentive to dates, is of course to be preferred. With the other
writers the Bishop’s affairs are secondary throughout, and the affairs
of Kent and Sussex are secondary in the first stage of the story.
Till they come to the exciting scenes of the sieges of Tunbridge and
Pevensey, the attention of the Chronicler, Florence, and the others,
is mainly given to the affairs of the region stretching from Ilchester
to Worcester. We may infer from them that the occupation of
Bristol and the march against Worcester did not happen till after
Easter, while we must infer from the Durham account that the
<a name="Page_474" id="Page_474"></a><span class="pageno">474</span>
movements in London, Kent, and Sussex, had happened not later
than the beginning of March. There is in short no real contradiction;
there is only that kind of difference which there is sure to
be found when one writer gives a general view of a large subject
with a general object, while another gives a minute view of one
part of the subject with a special object.</p>

<p>We can have little doubt in accepting the fact of the Bishop’s
treason, not only on the authority of the Chronicler and the other
writers who follow him, but on the strength of the proceedings in
the King’s court. In the Bishop’s own story a definite charge is
brought against him, and he never really answers it. He goes
off into a cloud of irrelevant questions, and into a statement of
services done to the King, a statement which most likely is perfectly
true, but which is no answer to the indictment. The great
puzzle of the whole story, namely why Bishop William should have
turned against the King at all, is not made any clearer on either
side.</p>

<p class="p2">It is certainly strange that this whole story of Bishop William,
so minutely told as it is and illustrating so many points in our law
and history, should have drawn to itself so little attention as it has
done. Thierry takes no notice of it. It would indeed be hard
to get anything about “Saxons and Normans” out of it. For,
though the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“indocta multitudo”</span> may fairly pass for “Saxons,” yet
these same “Saxons,” if hostile to the Cenomannian Bishop, are
loyally devoted to the Norman King. Lappenberg also passes by
the story altogether. Sir Francis Palgrave (Normandy and England,
<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 31, 46) makes some references to it which are provokingly
short, as it is the kind of story to which he could have done full
justice. Dr. Stubbs (<abbr title="Constitutional History one">Const. Hist. i.</abbr> 440) has given a summary of
the chief points in debate. But I believe that I may claim to be the
first modern writer who has told the tale at full length in a narrative
history. There are very few stories which bring the men and
the institutions of the latter part of the eleventh century before us
in a more living way, while the conduct of William of Saint-Calais
at this stage must specially be borne in mind when we come to
estimate his later conduct in the controversy with Anselm.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Deliverance of Worcester in 1088.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> story of the deliverance of Worcester is one of those stories
in which we can trace the early stages of legendary growth. It is
one of the tales in which a miraculous element appears, but in which
we can hardly say that there is any distortion of fact. The story
is told in a certain way, and with a certain colouring, with which
a modern writer would not tell it. Effects are attributed to causes
to which a modern writer would not attribute them. But this is
all. The mere facts are perfectly credible. There is no reason to
doubt that Wulfstan exhorted the royal troops and excommunicated
the rebels. There is no reason to doubt that the rebels were
utterly defeated by the royal troops. And we may well believe
that, in a certain sense, the defeat of the rebels was largely owing
to the exhortations and excommunications of Wulfstan. The only
legendary element in the story is to treat a result as miraculous
which, under the circumstances, was thoroughly natural.</p>

<p>We have several accounts from contemporary or nearly contemporary
writers. First comes the Peterborough Chronicler. After
the passage quoted in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 48, he goes on;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Ðas þing geseonde se arwurða bisceop Wlfstan wearð swiðe

<p>Here is nothing miraculous, only a very natural tendency to
ascribe the deliverance to the prayers and merits of the Bishop.
The version of Simeon of Durham (1088) gives us the “yearning”
of Wulfstan in the more dramatic shape of a spoken prayer;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Perrexerunt usque Wigornam, omnia ante se vastantes et
igne consumentes. Cogitaverunt etiam quod castrum et ecclesiam
vellent accipere, quod videlicet castrum tunc temporis commendatum
erat Wlstano venerabili episcopo. Quando episcopus ista
audivit, valde contristabatur, et cogitans quid consilii inde haberet,
vertit se ad Deum suum, et rogat ut respiciat ecclesiam suam et
populum suum ab hostibus oppressum. Hæc eo meditante, familia
<a name="Page_476" id="Page_476"></a><span class="pageno">476</span>
ejus exiliit de castro, et acceperunt et occiderunt ex eis quingentos
viros, et alios in fugam verterunt.”</p>

<p>In the version of Henry of Huntingdon (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 215, Arnold) we
again find only the prayer; but it is told with a picturesque
description of the Bishop lying before the altar, while the loyal
troops go forth, and, by a somewhat bold figure, the discomfiture
of the enemy is made to be the work of Wulfstan himself. The
number of the slain is also increased tenfold;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Principes Herefordscyre et Salopscyre prædantes combusserunt
cum Walensibus provinciam Wireceastre usque ad portas urbis.
Cum autem templum et castellum assilire pararent, Wlstanus
episcopus sanctus quendam amicum familiarem summis in necessitatibus
compellavit, Deum videlicet excelsum. Cujus ope coram
altari jacens in oratione, paucis militibus emissis, quinque mille
hostium vel occidit vel cepit; ceteros vero mirabiliter fugavit.”</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury in the Gesta Regum (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 306) gives the
prayer the form of a blessing on the King’s troops;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rogerius de Monte Gomerico, exercitum suum a Scrobesbiria
cum Walensibus mittens, coloniam Wigorniensem prædabatur;
jamque Wigorniam infestus advenerat, cum regii milites qui prætendebant,
<em>freti benedictione Wulstani episcopi</em>, cui custodia castelli
commissa erat, pauci multos effugarunt, pluribusque sauciis et cæsis,
quosdam abduxerunt.”</p>

<p>Orderic (666 D) cuts the matter very short; but it is in his
version that we first hear of Wulfstan cursing the rebels, as well as
blessing the King’s troops. Having mentioned Osbern and Bernard
(see <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 33, 34), he merely adds; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In territorio Wigornensi rapinis
et cædibus, <em>prohibente et anathematizante viro Dei Wlfstano episcopo</em>,
nequiter insistebant.”</span></p>

<p>Here one might almost think that the anathema was of none
effect. It is quite otherwise in the version which William of
Malmesbury gives in the Gesta Pontificum (285)&mdash;&#8203;in his special
Life of Wulfstan he leaves out the story altogether;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rogerius comes de Monte-gomerico, perfidiam contra principem
meditatus, cum ejusdem factionis complicibus arma movebat infestus.
Jamque, a Scrobbesberia usque Wigorniensem coloniam omnibus
vastatis, urbem ipsam appropinquabat; cum regii milites, qui prætendebant,
periculum exponunt episcopo. Is, maledictionis fulmen
jaculatus in perfidos qui domino suo fidem non servarent, jubet
<a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"></a><span class="pageno">477</span>
milites properare, Dei et ecclesiæ injurias ulturos. Mirum quis
dixerit quod subjiciam, sed auctoritati veracium narratorum cedendum?
Quidam enim adversariorum, regiis conspectis, timore inerti
perculsi, quidam etiam cæcati, victoriam plenam, et qualem sperare
nequibant, oppidanis cessere. Multi enim a paucis fugati, pars cæsi,
pars saucii abducti.”</p>

<p>We have here only the cursing without the blessing; the point
is that the curse is pronounced before the royal army sets out. The
anathema in this version has its full effect; the legendary element
appears in the story of the blindness of the enemy.</p>

<p>Lastly, we come to the account to which William most likely
alludes when he speaks of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“veraces narratores,”</span> that is, to the
minute account given by Florence, which I have mainly followed
in the text. His local knowledge and special interest in the story
led him to tell it in much fuller detail than is found anywhere else.
On the other hand, he gives a greater prominence than is given by
any one else to the wonder-working effects of Wulfstan’s curse.
This is only what was natural; it was in his own city, and above
all in his own monastery, that the merits and miracles of the saint
would be most fondly dwelled on, and most firmly believed in. At
Worcester, if anywhere, the tale of the deliverance of Worcester
was likely to grow. It is therefore in the local writer from whom
we get our most trustworthy details that we also find the first
approach to a really legendary element, though that element seems
to go no further than a slight change in the order of events which
brings out the saint’s powers more prominently. As we read the
other versions, above all the fuller one of William of Malmesbury
in the Gesta Pontificum, we should certainly infer that whatever
Wulfstan did in the way of praying, blessing, or cursing, was done
before the royal troops marched out of Worcester. In Florence the
blessing and the cursing stand apart. The Bishop goes into the
castle (see <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 49, 50); the royal troops of all kinds make ready
for battle, and meet the Bishop on his way to the castle, offering
to cross the river and attack the enemy, if he gives them leave.
He gives them leave, and promises them success (see <a href="#Page_50"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 50</a>). They
then cross the bridge, and see the enemy afar spoiling the lands of
the bishopric. On hearing of this, Wulfstan is persuaded to speak
his anathema, which at once takes effect in the wonderful overthrow
of the enemy.</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478"></a><span class="pageno">478</span>
“Res miranda, et Dei virtus et viri bonitas nimis in hoc prædicanda;
nam statim hostes, ut sparsi vagabantur per agros, tanta
membrorum percutiuntur debilitate, tanta exteriori oculorum attenuantur
cæcitate, ut vix arma valerent ferre, nec socios agnoscere,
nec eos discernere qui eis oberant ex adversa parte. Illos fallebat
cæcitatis ignorantia, nostros confortabat Dei et episcopalis benedictionis
confidentia. Sic illi insensati nec sciebant capere fugam,
nec alicujus defensionis quærebant viam; sed Dei nutu dati in
reprobum sensum, facile cedebant manibus inimicorum.”</p>

<p>Now this is a legend of the very simplest kind; or rather it is
not strictly a legend at all, but only a story on the way to become
a legend. Beyond a slight change in the order, there is no reason
to suspect that the facts of the case are at all misrepresented; they
are simply coloured in the way in which it was natural that the
successful party should colour them. There is in strictness no
miraculous element in the story; it has merely reached the stage
at which the germs of a miraculous element are beginning to show
themselves. That Wulfstan would encourage his people to fight in
a good cause, that he would pray for their success, we may feel
certain. That his exhortation might take the shape of a promise&mdash;&#8203;perhaps
only a conditional promise&mdash;&#8203;of victory is no more than was
natural. And an anathema pronounced against the rebels is as
natural as the blessing pronounced on the royal troops. We may
be sure that men stirred up by such exhortations and promises
would really fight the better for having heard them. And if the
fact that Wulfstan had pronounced an anathema, or even that he was
likely to pronounce an anathema, anyhow came to the knowledge
of the rebels, it is hardly less certain that they would fight the
worse for hearing of it. The only thing in which there is even
the germ of miracle is the statement that the invaders were smitten
with lameness or blindness or something like it, at the very moment
when the Bishop pronounced his excommunication. Now, in all
stories of this kind, we must bear in mind that mysterious power
of <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="phêmê">φήμη</span> (see <a href="#Page_309"><abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 309</a>), which I do not profess to explain,
but which certainly is a real thing. News certainly does
sometimes go at a wonderful pace; and the rebels might really
hear the news of Wulfstan’s excommunication so soon that it
would be a very slight exaggeration to say that it wrought an
effect on them at the very moment when it was uttered. A body
<a name="Page_479" id="Page_479"></a><span class="pageno">479</span>
of men who had already broken their ranks and were scattered
abroad for plunder hear that a sentence has been pronounced against
them by a man whose office and person were held in reverence
by all men, French and English&mdash;&#8203;for the Britons I cannot
answer. At this news they would surely fall into greater confusion
still, and would become an easy prey to the better disciplined
troops who had the Bishop’s exhortations and promises still ringing
in their ears. To say that such men, confused and puzzled, not
knowing which way to turn, were struck with sudden blindness
and lameness would be little more than a poetical way of describing
what really happened. That all this was owing to the prayers and
merits of Wulfstan would of course be taken for granted; that the
victory was owing to his prayers and merits is taken for granted in
those versions of the story which do not bring in the least approach
to a miraculous element. One change only in the story itself would
seem, as I have already hinted, to come from a legendary source.
I have in my own text, while following the details of Florence, not
scrupled so far to depart from his order as to make the Bishop’s
anathema come before, instead of after, the march of the royal troops
from the city. That is, I have made the blessing and cursing take
place at the same time. This seems better to agree with the
account in the Gesta Pontificum. And, following, as it seems to
me, the words of the Chronicle (geseonde), I have ventured to make
Wulfstan actually see the havoc wrought by the invaders, while we
should infer from Florence, as from Simeon, that he only heard of
it. It is of course part of the wonder that his anathema should
work its effect on men at a distance. By making these two small
changes&mdash;&#8203;which the other accounts seem to bear out&mdash;&#8203;in the narrative
of Florence, we get a version in which there is really no
legendary element at all, beyond the pious or poetical way in which
the discomfiture of the enemy is spoken of. To say that the
enemy were smitten with blindness and lameness was an obvious
figure of speech. To say that they were so smitten by virtue of
the Bishop’s anathema was, in the ideas of those times, no figure
of speech at all, but a natural inference from the fact. To say that
they were smitten, while still at a distance, at the very moment
when the Bishop pronounced the anathema was an improvement,
perhaps rather a devout inference, so very obvious that it hardly
marks a later stage in the story. The tale is as yet hardly legendary;
<a name="Page_480" id="Page_480"></a><span class="pageno">480</span>
it is only on the point of becoming so. But it is the kind of
story which one would have expected to grow. Yet those later
writers who mention the matter seem simply to copy Florence,
without bringing in any further improvements of their own. It is
strange that, in the local Annals, as in the Life of Wulfstan, the
deliverance of Worcester is left out altogether.</p>

<p class="p2">The story of the deliverance of Worcester may be compared
with the story of the overthrow of Swegen at Gainsburgh. See
<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume one page">N. C. vol. i. p.</abbr> 366. But the Worcester story is in an earlier stage
than the Gainsburgh story. The main difference is that the
hero of the one story was dead, while the hero of the other story
was alive. The living Bishop of Worcester could not, even in
a figure or in a legend, be brought in as acting as the dead and
canonized King of the East-Angles could be made to act. The
utmost that could be done in this way was when Henry of
Huntingdon speaks of the exploits of the loyal army as the personal
exploits of the Bishop whom he describes as lying before the altar.
Wulfstan, notwithstanding his youthful skill in military exercises
(see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume two page">N. C. vol. ii. p.</abbr> 470), could not be brought in as smiting the
enemy, lance in hand, as Saint Eadmund did Swegen.</p>

<p>Another story of an army smitten with blindness is that of
the Normans at Northallerton in 1069 (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 241).
And a scene not unlike the scene before Worcester, though the
circumstances are all different, and the position of the bishop
in the story is specially different, is to be found in the rout of the
Cenomannian army before Sillé in 1073 (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 553).</p>

<p class="p2">Two small questions of fact arise out of the comparison of our
authorities. The expressions of the Chronicler (“forðig him
was betæht þe castel to healdene”), of Simeon, and of William
of Malmesbury in the Gesta Regum (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“cui custodia castelli commissa
erat”</span>) would certainly lead us to think that Wulfstan was actually
commanding for the King in the castle when the rebellion began.
The detailed narrative in Florence makes him go to the castle
only at the special request of the garrison when the enemy are
on their march. There is perhaps no formal contradiction. Wulfstan
had before now held military command (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 579),
and he might have the command of the castle without being actually
<a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a><span class="pageno">481</span>
within its walls. But the story in Florence does not set Wulfstan
before us as an actual military commander, but rather as a person
venerated of all men whose approval of the course to be taken
was sought by those who were in command. It is safest to take
the detailed story in Florence, and to take the words of the
Chronicler and of Simeon and William as the laxer way of
speaking used by men who did not aim at the same local precision.
The Bishop might in some sort be said to have the castle entrusted
to him when the garrison had asked him to come into it.</p>

<p>The other point is that William of Malmesbury in both his
versions seems to make Earl Roger present in person before
Worcester. But the language of the other accounts (see <a href="#Page_47"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 47</a>) seems
carefully to imply that, though he joined in the “unrede,” and
though his men were engaged in the revolt on the border,
yet he had not himself any personal share in that campaign. It
is certain that, when we next hear of him (see <a href="#Page_58"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 58</a>), it is in quite
another character and in quite another part of England.</p>

<p class="p2">A lately published record brings in a new actor in the defence of
Worcester. This is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Annales de ecclesiis et regnis Anglorum”</span>
in Liebermann’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Ungedruckte Anglo-Normannische Geschichtsquellen,”</span>
22. This contains an account of the deliverance of Worcester,
enlarged from Florence, in which Abbot Guy of Pershore
appears as Wulfstan’s military lieutenant; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Intererat quidam
consilio providus Wido Persorcusis abbas. Hunc ultro se offerentem
jus pontificale creans ad tempus militem, statuit belli ducem
totum in Deo et in orationibus episcopi confidentem.”</span> Guy was the
successor of Thurstan (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four pages">N. C. vol. iv. pp.</abbr> 384, 697) who died in
1087. He was one of the abbots deposed by Anselm in 1102. As
Anselm himself had held a military command, the deposition could
hardly have been on the ground of Guy’s exploits on this day.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Attempted Landing of the Normans at Pevensey.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is with some hesitation that I have spoken as I have done
in the text, because it is hard to reconcile our authorities without
supposing that the siege of Pevensey was accompanied by a sea-force
<a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"></a><span class="pageno">482</span>
on the part of the King. No ships have been spoken of
before; none are distinctly mentioned now; some of the descriptions
might be understood only of a land-force lining the shore; but
operations on the water seem implied in some of the accounts, and
they may be understood in any. There is no need to think of a
great fleet; the sea-faring men of the neighbourhood could surely
do all that is recorded to have been done.</p>

<p>The words of the Chronicler, of William of Malmesbury, and of
Henry of Huntingdon, might be understood merely of a land-force
employed to keep the enemy from landing; but their expressions
may be quite as naturally taken of operations on the
water as well. The Chronicler is emphatic on the exploit of the
English;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Ac þa Englisce men þe wærdedon þære sæ gelæhton of þam
mannon and slogon, and adrengton ma þonne ænig man wiste
to tellanne.”</p>

<p>So Henry of Huntingdon (215); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Anglici mare custodientes
occiderunt et submerserunt ex illis innumerabiles.”</span></p>

<p>The details come from William of Malmesbury, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 306;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Inter has obsidionis moras, homines regis mare custodientes
quosdam quos comes Normanniæ in auxilium perfidorum miserat,
partim cæde, partim naufragio, oppressere: reliqui fugam intendentes

destituti, ludibrio nostris, sibi exitio, fuere; nam, ne vivi caperentur,
e transtris se in mare præcipitarunt.”</p>

<p>It is Simeon of Durham (1088) who more distinctly brings
out the features of a fight by sea;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex Willelmus jam mare munierat suis piratis, qui venientes
in Angliam tot occiderunt et in mare merserunt, ut nullus sit
hominum qui sciat numerum pereuntium.”</p>

<p>This seems to come from the Chronicle; but “þa Englisce men
þe wærdedon þære sæ” are distinctly sent on board vessels of some
kind by the name of “piratæ.”</p>

<p>The “pirates” too and the sea-fight come out more distinctly
in the narrative of the Hyde writer quoted above (see <a href="#Page_76"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 76</a>). His
tale must really mean the attack on Pevensey with which we are
now dealing, though he has strangely confused times, places, and
persons.</p>

<p>Roger of Wendover (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 34) gives the narrative of William of
<a name="Page_483" id="Page_483"></a><span class="pageno">483</span>
Malmesbury a new turn, and specially puts the “perfidi” of his
version in an unlooked-for light;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Inter has obsidionis moras, ministri regis mare custodientes
quosdam quos dux Robertus in auxilium prædictorum miserat

<p class="center sc">The Bishopric of Somerset and the Abbey of Bath.</p>

<p><span class="sc">William</span> of Malmesbury (<abbr title="Gesta Pontificum">Gest. Pont.</abbr> 194) has got wrong in his
chronology when he makes John already bishop before the death
of the Conqueror, but unable to carry out his scheme for the
removal of the bishopric till the accession of Rufus. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Minoris
gloriæ putans si in <em>villa</em></span> [should this be some form of <em>Wells</em>?]
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">resideret inglorius, transferre thronum in Bathoniam animo intendit.
Sed cum id inaniter, vivente Willelmo patre, cogitasset,
tempore Willelmi filii effecit.”</span> Gisa certainly did not die till
1088, and John was consecrated in July of that year. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Qui
cum rex excellentissimus Willielmus senior, qui <abbr title="22">xxij.</abbr> annis regnaverat,
fine laudabili vitam conclusisset, et Willielmus junior
filius ejus pro eo regnaret, consecratus est episcopus in Julio.”</span>
(Historiola, 21.)</p>

<p>The transfer of the bishopric to Bath and the union of the
abbey with the bishopric are undoubted facts; as the writer of
the Historiola says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Statim cathedram pontificis transtulit de
Wella Bathoniæ.”</span> The charter of William Rufus making this
grant is printed in the Monasticon, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 266; the original is preserved
in the chapter library at Wells. It is in two handwritings, the
former part containing the first grant of 1088, while the second
consists of a confirmation of 1090, or rather 1091. The substance
of the grant is contained in the words;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ego Willelmus Willelmi regis filius, Dei dispositione monarches
<a name="Page_484" id="Page_484"></a><span class="pageno">484</span>

et populi a Domino mihi collati salute, concessi Johanni

tam in villis quam in civitate et in consuetudinibus, illis videlicet,
quibus saisita erat ea die qua regnum suscepi. Dedi, inquam, ad
Sumersetensis episcopatus augmentationem, eatenus præsertim ut
inibi instituat præsuleam sedem.”</p>

<p>On the use of the title “monarches Britanniæ,” see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume one page">N. C. vol. i.
p.</abbr> 561. It is somewhat singular that, when Henry of Huntingdon
(211) speaks of the Conqueror as leaving <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>regnum</em> Angliæ”</span> to his
second son, Robert of Torigny, in his own Chronicle, 1085, changes
it into <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>monarchiam</em> Angliæ.”</span></p>

<p>The date of the first grant is thus given;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Lanfranco archipræsule machinante, Wintoniæ factum est
donum hujus beneficii, <abbr title="1088">mill. lxxxviiiᵒ.</abbr> anno ab incarnatione
Domini, secundo vero anno regni regis Willelmi filii prioris
Willelmi.”</p>

<p>The second year of William Rufus takes in from September 26,
1088, to September 26, 1089. It is perhaps not necessary to suppose
that this first grant was made in an assembly at all. If it
was, we must either suppose an extraordinary assembly in the
autumn of 1088 (for we have seen by the story of Bishop William
of Durham that the Christmas assembly of that year was held as
usual at Westminster, see <a href="#Page_116"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 116</a>), or else we must suppose that
it was done in the Easter assembly of 1089. Yet it is rather
straining chronology, even if we begin the year at Easter, to reckon
that assembly to 1088. (In 1089 Easter-day fell on April 1st.)
But that the dates of this charter begin the year at some time
later than the 1st of January is plain from the confirmation, which
was made at Dover <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“anno Dominicæ incarnationis <abbr title="1090">mill. xc.</abbr> regni
vero mei <abbr title="4">iiii.</abbr> indictione <abbr title="13 6">xiii. vi.</abbr> kal. Febr. luna <abbr title="3">iii.</abbr>”</span> This must
mean the January of 1091, as the January of 1090 comes in the
third, not in the fourth, year of Rufus. Also the charter is signed
by Ralph Bishop of Chichester and Herbert Bishop of Thetford,
who did not become bishops till 1091, and who thus seem to
have been consecrated very early in the year. The confirmation
would thus seem to have been made just before William Rufus
crossed into Normandy in 1091 (see <a href="#Page_273"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 273</a>), when Dover was a
likely place to find him at. A long list of signatures was made
<a name="Page_485" id="Page_485"></a><span class="pageno">485</span>
ready, though some only of the names actually received the cross
from the signer’s own hand. Among these indeed are the names
of Ralph and Herbert themselves, as well as those of Saint Wulfstan
and Bishop Geoffrey of Coutances. Bishop Howel of Le Mans
signs with his own hand, and after the abbots comes the unsigned
name of “Gosfridus Mala Terra” without any further description.
Can this be the historian of the Apulian wars? The earls and
counts whose names are given are Roger (of Shrewsbury), Robert
(of Mortain or of Meulan?), Simon (of Northampton), Hugh (of
Chester), Alan (of Britanny and Richmond), Henry, Walter, and
William. Of these, Roger, Simon, and Alan actually sign. Earl
Walter must be Walter Giffard, created Earl of Buckingham by
Rufus (see Stubbs, <abbr title="Constitutional History one">Const. Hist. i.</abbr> 361). Henry must be Henry
Earl of Warwick, brother of Robert of Meulan (see Will. Gem.
<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 4; <abbr title="Orderic Vitalis">Ord. Vit.</abbr> 676 A; <abbr title="William of Malmesbury five">Will. Malms. v.</abbr> 393; Stubbs, <abbr title="ut sequitur">u. s.</abbr>),
and William must be the younger William of Warren, Earl of
Surrey, that is, if his father died as is asserted by the Hyde
writer, or even so soon as we should infer from Orderic (680 D).
The signatures to this charter thus help us in fixing the dates of
the creation of these earldoms. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Robertus cancellarius”</span> is the
future Bishop of Lincoln. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Samson capellanus,”</span> who does not
sign though his name is there, must surely be he who refused
the bishopric of Le Mans (see <a href="#Page_205"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 205</a>), or else he who was afterwards
Bishop of Worcester (see <a href="#Page_542"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 542</a>), if the two are not the
same. Among smaller lay names are many with which we are
familiar. The name of Robert Fitz-hamon stands apart after the
earls, marking his special position in the King’s favour. The name
of Randolf Peverel, whom we have met with in the story of Bishop
William (see <a href="#Page_109"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 109</a>), is followed in the original by that of William
Peverel, which is left out in the Monasticon. The Sheriff Aiulf
(see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 163) and Ælfred of Lincoln (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume three page">N. C. vol. iii.
p.</abbr> 778) are the only names which can be those of Englishmen. So
soon were the promises of the Red King forgotten.</p>

<p>It was almost needless on the part of Roger of Wendover (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 42),
or whoever he followed, to say that the change was made <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“consensu
Willelmi regis, <em>albo unguento manibus ejus delibatis</em>,”</span> a
phrase which reminds one of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“candidi nummi”</span> in Domesday, 164.</p>

<p>Of the two societies which this change so deeply affected, we
<a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a><span class="pageno">486</span>
hear the moan of the monks of Bath in William of Malmesbury
(<abbr title="Gestis Pontificum">Gest. Pont.</abbr> 195), and that of the canons of Wells in the local
Historiola (22). Of Bishop John’s doings at Bath we read;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Primo aliquantum dure in monachos agebat, quod essent
hebetes et ejus æstimatione barbari, et omnes terras, victualium
ministras, auferens, pauculumque victum per laicos suos exiliter inferens.
Sed, procedentibus annis, factis novis monachis, mitius se
agere, aliquantulum terrarum, quo se hospitesque suos quoquomodo
sustentarent, priori indulgens. Multa ibi nobiliter per eum incepta
et consummata, in ornamentis et libris, maximeque monachorum
congregatione, qui sunt scientia literarum et sedulitate
officiorum juxta prædicabiles…. Obiit grandævus, qui nec etiam
moriens emolliri potuit, ut plena manu monachorum terras redderet,
successoribus suis non imitandum præbens exemplum.”</p>

<p>The Wells tale forms a very remarkable piece of local history,
the main features of which are given in the local Historiola (22),
and which has been illustrated by Dr. Stubbs.</p>

<p>Our more general history is chiefly concerned with the undoing
of the work of Gisa;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Domiciliis quoque canonicorum quæ Gyso venerabilis construxerat,
refectorio scilicet et dormitorio necnon et cellario et aliis
officinis necessariis, cum claustro dirutis, canonici foras ejecti coacti
sunt cum populo communiter vivere, quos Gyso docuerat regulariter
et religiose cohabitare.”</p>

<p>He afterwards, we are told, repented; but the canons of Wells
did not recover their property till the days of Bishop Robert
(1136&ndash;1166), who, though himself a monk, settled the constitution
of the church of Wells after the usual pattern of secular
chapters.</p>

<p>The later Wells writer in Anglia Sacra, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 560, tells this story,
that is the story of the Historiola, with a few further touches.
We read how John, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“inconsultis canonicis Wellensibus et præter
eorum consensum, transtulit sedem episcopalem Wellensem in abbatiam
Bathoniensem … et dimisso nomine episcopatus Wellensis,
primus omnium fecit se Bathoniensem episcopum appellari.”</span>
This last charge is doubtless true; but it may be doubted whether
the bishopric of the Sumorsætan, though its bishopsettle was at
Wells, had ever been know by the local style of bishopric of
Wells (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume two pages">N. C. vol. ii. pp.</abbr> 606, 608). He tells the story of the
<a name="Page_487" id="Page_487"></a><span class="pageno">487</span>
destruction of the canonical buildings, with the addition that
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“fundum in quo prius habitabant sibi et suis successoribus usurpavit,
palatiumque suum episcopale ibidem construxit.”</span> One is
almost inclined to think that there is here some confusion between
John’s two sets of victims, at Bath and at Wells. The use of the
word “palatium” is later than the days of John; but he doubtless
did build his chief house at Bath, and it may very likely have been
at the cost of the monks. He is not at all likely, when forsaking
Wells, to have built himself a house there, and, unless Bishop
Robert in the next century altogether changed the site of the
church, no cloister can ever have stood on the site of the present
palace of Wells. Yet the building of the house supplies a motive
for pulling down the cloister, which otherwise seems to be lacking.</p>

<p class="p2">The grant of the city of Bath to Bishop John was first made
by William Rufus, and was afterwards confirmed by Henry the
First. The first grant is recorded in the Historiola (21);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cum in multis et magnis obsequendo regis familiaritatem
obtineret, impetravit ab ipso sibi civitatem Bathoniæ.”</p>

<p>The confirmation by Henry is recorded by Florence (1122), and
by William of Malmesbury, <abbr title="Gestis Pontificum">Gest. Pont.</abbr> 194;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nec eo contentus, totam etiam civitatem in suos et successorum
usus transtulit, ab Henrico rege quingentis libris argenti mercatus
urbem, in qua balnearum calidarum latex emergens auctorem
Julium Cæsarem habuisse creditur.”</p>

<p>(He goes on with more about the Bath waters and the history
of the place.)</p>

<p>The Monasticon contains several charters bearing on this matter
(<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 267, 268). There is first the charter of Rufus, addressed
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“O[smundo] episcopo Saresbergensi et T[urstano] abbati, Glastoniensi
et A[iulfo?] vicecomiti, <em>omnibusque baronibus Francigenis
et Anglis</em> de Sumerseta et de Wiltunscire,”</span> which grants
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“totam civitatem Bathoniæ in eleemosynam et ad augmentationem
pontificalis sedis suæ … ut cum maximo honore pontificalem suam
habeat sedem.”</span> Then comes one of Henry’s grants at Windsor
in 1101, when he says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Renovavi donum quod fecerat frater
meus Willelmus rex de civitate Bathoniæ, et eamdem civitatem
donavi Deo et beato Petro apostolo et Johanni episcopo, cum
omnibus consuetudinibus et appendiciis quæ ad ipsum pertinent,</span>
<a name="Page_488" id="Page_488"></a><span class="pageno">488</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">civitatem constitui et concessi, ut ibi deinceps sit caput et mater
ecclesia totius episcopatus de Sumersete.”</span></p>

<p>Another charter of Henry, confirming various privileges, is
granted at Bishop’s Waltham in 1111 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in transitu regis in Normanniam”</span>
(see the Chronicle, 1111, and <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 182). It
says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eam donationem quam donavi Deo et sancto Petro in Batha,
ubi frater meus Willielmus et ego constituimus et confirmavimus
sedem episcopatus totius Summersetæ, quæ olim erat apud villam quæ
dicitur Wella, scilicet ipsam urbem et omnia pertinentia ad firmam
ejusdem civitatis, dono et confirmo ipsi Domino nostro Jesu Christo
et beato apostolo Petro et Johanni episcopo ejusque successoribus
jure perpetuo et hæreditario.”</span></p>

<p>Another from Geddington in 1102 is addressed to a string of
great men, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“omnibusque baronibus Francigenis et Angligenis de
Sumerset et de omni Anglia.”</span></p>

<p>The wording of these charters illustrates a crowd of points which
we have come across at various times, as the name of the land
of Somerset, the use of “jus hæreditarium,” and specially the
“barones [þegnas] Angligenæ.” Among the signatures the charter
of 1111 has the unsigned names of two Romans, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Johannes
Tusculanus episcopus”</span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tyberius dapifer et legatus.”</span> (This
Tiberius is spoken of again in a letter of Anselm to Gundulf, <abbr title="Epistle three">Ep. iii.</abbr>
85, and in a letter to King Henry, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 86, therefore before 1108,
the date of Gundulf’s death, but after the promotion of Gerard
to the archbishopric of York; he was in England on business
about the Romescot.) The second has the name of “Johannes
Baiocensis,” seemingly the son of Bishop Odo. Naturally neither
King makes any mention of the five hundred pounds which,
according to William of Malmesbury, the Bishop paid for the
grant.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is Bishop John’s charter of 1106 (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“regnante Henrico
filio magni Willelmi <em>Northmannorum ducis</em> et Anglorum regis”</span>),
which records his own acts, and makes some restitution at least to
the monks;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Notum vobis facio quod ad honorem Dei et sancti Petri
elaboravi et ad effectum perduxi, <em>cum decenti auctoritate</em>, ut caput
et mater ecclesia totius episcopatus de Sumerseta sit in urbe
Bathonia in ecclesia S. Petri. Cui beato apostolo et servitoribus
ejus monachis reddidi terras eorum quas aliquamdiu injuste tenueram
<a name="Page_489" id="Page_489"></a><span class="pageno">489</span>
in manu mea, ita integre et libere sicut Alsius abbas ante me
tenuit.”</p>

<p>He grants them certain lands which he had bought, amongst
others the estate of Hugh or Hugolin with the Beard, a purchase
mentioned also in the Historiola, where the price is given at sixty
pounds. A comparison of the three places in Domesday 49 <span class="decoration">b</span>, 50 <span class="decoration">b</span>,
and 99 seems to show that Mr. Hunter (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 38) is right in making
“Hugo barbatus” in Hampshire and “Hugolinus interpres” the
same man. But he leaves out his third description in 50 <span class="decoration">b</span> as
“Hugo latinarius.” It is some comfort to learn from Mr. Hunter
that the “taini regis” were “a very respectable class;” but it
is perhaps more important to note that we have here a “tainus
Francigena” to match the “barones Angligenæ.” Some of Hugh’s
lands had been held of Earl Tostig by one Siward.</p>

<p class="p2">In the Monasticon (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 264) and the Codex Diplomaticus (<abbr title="six">vi.</abbr>
209&ndash;211) are some English documents, chiefly sales and manumissions,
done at Bath in the days of Abbot Ælfsige and Bishop
John. As usual in these private documents, there is a great
mixture of Norman and English names among the signatures.
Take such a list as this in <abbr title="Codex Diplomaticus six">Cod. Dipl. vi.</abbr> 210;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Osward preóst, and Willelm ðe clerce, and Hugo ðe postgerefa,
and Beóring, and Leófríc, and Heoðewulf, and Burchhard, and
Wulwi, and Geosfræi, and Ælfword ðe smið, and Eádwi se rédes
sune, and Rodberd ðe Frencisce.”</p>

<p>Here we have one of our puzzling Domesday Ælfreds (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest five">N. C.
v.</abbr> 737, 777) witnessing a manumission of Bishop John;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Her swutelað on ðisse Cristes béc ðæt Lifgið æt Forda is
gefreód and hire twa cild for ðone biscop Iohanne and for ealne
ðone hired on Baðon on Ælfredes gewitnesse Aspania.”</p>

<p>Again in Monasticon, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 265 (<abbr title="compare page">cf. p.</abbr> 269), we have a somewhat
puzzling mention of an Abbot Wulfwold as well as Ælfsige;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Her geswytelað on þysan gewrite þa forefarde þa Willelm
Hosatt geworhte wið Wlfwold abbod, and wið Ælfsige abbod and
wið eall þone hired on Baðan.”</p>

<p>All this must be a little startling to those who believe that the
Conqueror ordered all documents to be drawn up in French.</p>

<p>There is also a Latin document printed in the Archæological
Journal, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 145, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 83, in which William of Moion, the first
<a name="Page_490" id="Page_490"></a><span class="pageno">490</span>
Norman lord of Dunster, grants the church of Dunster to Bishop
John and his monks (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ecclesiæ beati Petri de Bathonia et Johanni
<em>episcopo ejusdem monasterii</em> et monachis tam præsentibus quam
futuris”</span>). William of Moion’s witnesses seem to be all Normans;
but we get some English names among those on the part of the
Bishop; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Gireuuardus monachus et Girebertus archidiaconus et
Dunstanus sacerdos et Gillebertus sacerdos et Willelmus clericus
et Adelardus dapifer et Turaldus et Sabianus.”</span></p>

<p>There is a letter of Anselm (<abbr title="Epistles three">Ep. iii.</abbr> 151) addressed to John
Prior of Bath and the monks, but it contains no historical information.
John was the first Prior after the change of foundation.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Character of William Rufus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Some</span> of the main points in the character of William Rufus are
not badly hit off by Giraldus (de <abbr title="Instructione Principum three">Inst. Princ. iii.</abbr> 30), though there
are features on which he does not dwell;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Erat rex ille strenuus in armis et animosus, sed tyrannus, adeo
militiam diligens ecclesiamque Dei exosam habens ut monasteria
cuncta domosque religiosas ab Anglis olim per Angliam fundatas
et ditatas, cum terris omnibus et possessionibus, vel ex majori
mutilare vel in militares feodos convertere proposuisset.”</p>

<p>These last words are of importance for another part of our
inquiry (see <a href="#Page_346"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 346</a>); but the general phrase <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“militiam diligens,”</span>
a phrase capable of more meanings than one, is, in all its meanings,
strictly applicable to Rufus.</p>

<p>Part of the character of him given by the Hyde writer (299)
has been already quoted (see <a href="#Page_353"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 353</a>). He is brought in as follows,
with the further note that he was “nimis amator pecuniæ;”</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmus rex animo ferus, corpore strenuus, defensor quidem
patriæ cœpit esse, sed non satis idoneus procreator [protector? or is
a “nursing-father” meant?] ecclesiæ. Si enim ita studeret religioni
quam vanæ curiositati, nullus ei profecto deberet princeps
comparari.”</p>

<p>Geoffrey Gaimar (<abbr title="Anglo Norman Chronicle one">Chron. Ang. Norm. i.</abbr> 30) brings him on the
stage with some respect;</p>

<div class="poem">
<a name="Page_491" id="Page_491"></a><span class="pageno">491</span>
<div class="i0a">“Willam out non come son père,</div>
<div class="i0">Et cil refut mult allosé.</div>
<div class="i0">Englois, Normanz, l’ont honuré;</div>
<div class="i0">Tant come le duc ala conquere,</div>
<div class="i0">Le firent roi en Engleterre;</div>
<div class="i0">Et il la tint et bien regna,</div>
<div class="i0">Normanz, Englois, fort justisa,</div>
<div class="i0">Tote la terre mist en peès.”</div>
</div>

<p>(For “honuré” another reading is “coroné.”) He then goes on to
the war in Maine, so closely that he reaches Seez on his march
soon enough for the name of that city to rime with “peès.”</p>

<p>But, after the picture in the Chronicles (1100), the character of
William Rufus is best studied in the two works of William of Malmesbury.
On the account in the Gesta Regum I have of course drawn
largely; it is in fact, with some help from Orderic, our main storehouse.
The tone which its writer takes throughout is very remarkable;
he tries to make the best of things without directly contradicting
the facts. In his prologue to the fourth book he complains
of the difficulty, one which has not lessened since his time, of telling
the exact truth about recent matters, especially when kings are
concerned; and he at last lays down a rule which would forbid
any <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">suggestio falsi</em>, but would allow a good deal of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">suppressio
veri</em>;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dicam in hoc libro … quidquid de Willelmo filio Willelmi
magni dici poterit, ita ut nec veritas rerum titubet, <em>nec principalis
decoloretur majestas</em>.”</p>

<p>He brings William Rufus in in the beginning of the book itself;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Incomparabilis proculdubio nostro tempore princeps, si non
eum magnitudo patris obrueret, nec ejus juventutem fata præcipitassent,
ne per ætatem maturiorem aboleret errores licentia potestatis
et impetu juvenili contractos.”</p>

<p>Certainly Rufus, like many other sinners, might have reformed;
but the charitable hope is made less likely by the general witness,
including that of the writer himself, that he grew worse and worse.
For William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 312) says himself;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Excellebat in eo magnanimitas, quam ipse processu temporis
nimia severitate obfuscavit; ita in ejus furtim pectus vitia pro
virtutibus serpebant ut discernere nequiret. Diu dubitavit mundus
quo tandem vergeret, quo se inclinaret, indoles illius. Inter initia,
vivente Lanfranco archiepiscopo, ab omni crimine abhorrebat, ut
unicum fore regum speculum speraretur; quo defuncto, aliquamdiu
varium se præstitit æquali lance vitiorum atque virtutum, jam
vero, postremis annis bonorum gelante studio, incommodorum seges
<a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"></a><span class="pageno">492</span>
succrescens incaluit. Et erat ita liberalis quod prodigus, ita magnanimus
quod superbus, ita severus quod sævus. Liceat enim mihi,
pace majestatis regiæ, verum non occuluisse, quia iste parum Deum
reverebatur, nihil homines.”</p>

<p>He then gives some details, most of which I have quoted already,
and adds an elaborate discourse on real and false liberality. He is
obliged to allow (<abbr title="ibid">ib.</abbr> 313) that the liberality of William Rufus was
of the latter kind;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quidam, cum non habeant quod dent, ad rapinas convertuntur,
majusque odium assequuntur ab his quibus auferunt quam beneficium
ab his quibus contulerunt; <em>quod huic regi accidisse dolemus</em>.”</p>

<p>Some way on, after more about his liberality, followed by the
description of the vices of the court, of which more anon, and a
short reference to Anselm and Eadmer, comes (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 316) a most
singular passage;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Vides quantus e liberalitate quam putabat fomes malorum
eruperit. In quibus corrigendis quia ipse non tam exhibuit diligentiam
quam prætendebat negligentiam, magnam et vix abolendam
incurrit infamiam; immerito, credo, quia nunquam se tali supponeret
probro qui se tanto meminisset prælatum imperio. Hæc
igitur ideo inelaborato et celeri sermone convolvo, quia de tanto
rege mala dicere erubesco, in dejiciendis et extenuandis malis
laborans.”</p>

<p>Then come the anecdotes, the annals of the reign, and the account
of the King’s death. Then (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 333) we get another small picture
of him, how he was</p>

<p lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ingentia præsumens, et ingentia, si pensa Parcarum evolvere
vel violentiam fortunæ abrumpere et eluctari potuisset, facturus.”</p>

<p>Lastly, he is dismissed with this general character;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Vir sacrati ordinis hominibus, pro damno animæ cujus salutem
revocare laborent, maxime miserandus; stipendiariis militibus pro
copia donativorum mirandus; provincialibus, quod eorum substantias
abradi sinebat, non desiderandus.”</p>

<p>The <cite>Gesta Regum</cite> was the courtly book, written for courtly
readers, and dedicated to Earl Robert, the Red King’s nephew.
The subject demanded that the writer should say something about
the Red King; he had no mind to tell actual lies; so he made
the best of him that he could without telling any. But William
of Malmesbury also wrote the <cite>Gesta Pontificum</cite> for ecclesiastical
<a name="Page_493" id="Page_493"></a><span class="pageno">493</span>
readers. In that book bishops were the main subject; kings came
in only incidentally. But, when he did speak of them, he was not
under the same necessity as he was in his other work of speaking
of them with bated breath. In this work he treated William
Rufus very much as he treated several bishops, William’s own
Flambard among them. He first wrote a most severe character
of him, and then cut it out altogether. The passages which thus
perished in the second edition are printed in Mr. Hamilton’s notes,
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 73, 79, 84, 104. In the first place (73) he tells us how the King,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“abjecto respectu omnis boni, omnia ecclesiastica in fiscum redegit.”</span>
He was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“juvenili calore et regio fastu præfervidus, humana divinaque
juxta ponderans et sui juris æstimans.”</span> But he has spoken of
his ways elsewhere&mdash;&#8203;doubtless in the <cite>Gesta Regum</cite>&mdash;he will now
speak of them only as occasion serves. In the next place (79) he
wrote at first;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Licet nulla Dei consideratio, nulla cujuscunque hominis sanctitas,
ejus proterviam sedare possent, adeo cuncta quæ sibi dicebantur vel
turbida ira vel facetis, ut sibi videbatur, salibus eludebat.”</p>

<p>This was too strong; in the second edition things are put in
another light;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hoc in rege magnificum videri debet, quod qui omnia pro
potestate facere posset, magis quædam joco eludebat, ad sales multa
extra judicium animi transferens.”</p>

<p>The third passage (84) comes in the story of Anselm; the part of
it which concerns us here runs thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex in eum [Anselmum] et in omnes venabatur lites, commentabatur
caussas quibus congregaret pecunias. In exactionibus
sævus, in male partis dispertiendo prodigus, ibi harpyiarum ungues,
hic Cleopatræ luxum, in utroque impudentiam prætendens. Si
quis ei sponte quid obtulisset, nisi quantitas dati suæ conveniret
menti, statim obliquo intuitu exterrebat quoad illum ad quas liberet
doni conditiones adduceret.”</p>

<p>The last passage (104) also comes in the story of Anselm. William’s
character is thus drawn;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Protervus et arrogans, æque in Deum ut in homines rebellis,
religioni Christianæ magis ex usu quam amore addictus, ut qui
plures Judæos Christianos factos ad Judaismum pecuniis corruptus
revocaret. Omnia fato agi credulus, nullum sanctorum nos posse
adjuvare credebat et dicebat, subinde increpitans et dicens, scilicet
<a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a><span class="pageno">494</span>
ea cura jam olim mortuos sollicitat ut nostris intersint negotiis.
Proindeque, si ab apostolico excommunicaretur, in secundis haberet,
qui quantum suæ conscientiæ interesset, non multum curaret
si totis annis sacramentorum expers esset.”</p>

<p>This last passage is remarkable, as seeming to show that Rufus
rather wondered that he was not excommunicated (see <a href="#Page_611"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 611</a>).
And one wonders too, on reading this passage and some others
(see <a href="#Page_166"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 166</a>), that no controversialist has ever claimed Rufus as a
premature Protestant. Even Sir Richard Baker, a yet more loyal
apologist than the author of the <cite>Gesta Regum</cite>, did not hit upon
that.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury then goes on to tell the story of the
accused deer-stealers&mdash;&#8203;doubtless from Eadmer, to whom he so often
refers&mdash;&#8203;and then gives some reasons for not enlarging further on
the evil doings of Rufus. One is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quod non debeam defunctum
meo premere judicio qui habet judicem præfata [sic], cui judicanti
omnis attremit creatura.”</span> The other is that it is better, for the
sake of edification, to pass by evil doings, especially some kinds of
evil doings; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Adulterium discitur dum narratur, et omne crimen
faciendum menti male inculcatur, dum qualiter ab alio factum sit
studiosius explicatur.”</span></p>

<p class="p2">Orderic is in this case less elaborate in his portrait-painting than
William of Malmesbury. Some of his sayings bearing on the
character of William Rufus have been already quoted. He sometimes
brings him in, after his fashion, with some epithet, appropriate
or quaint&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“liberalis rex,” “turgidus rex,” “pomposus sceptriger,”</span>
and the like. But he twice gives something like a full-length
picture. The first is at 680 A;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In diebus illis lucerna veræ sanctitatis obscurius micabat pene
cunctis in ordinibus, mundique principes cum subjectis agminibus
inhærebant tenebrosis operibus. Guillelmus Rufus Albionis rex
juvenis erat protervus et lascivus, quem nimis inhianter prosequebantur
agmina populorum impudicis moribus. Imperiosus et audax
atque militaris erat, et multitudine militum pompose tripudiabat.
Militiæ titulis applaudebat, illisque propter fastum secularem admodum
favebat. Pagenses contra milites defendere negligebat, quorum
possessiones a suis tironibus et armigeris impune devastari
permittebat. Tenacis memoriæ et ardentis ad bonum seu malum
<a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a><span class="pageno">495</span>
voluntatis erat. Terribilis furibus et latrunculis imminebat, pacemque
serenam per subjectam regionem servari valenter cogebat.
Omnes incolas regni sui aut illexit largitate, aut compressit virtute
et terrore, ut nullus contra eum auderet aliquo modo mutire.”</p>

<p>This comes just before the pious and humane speech (see <a href="#Page_223"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 223</a>),
in which Rufus proposes the first war in Normandy. Towards the
end of the reign of Rufus (763 C), Orderic takes up his brush
again;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Guillelmus Ruffus, militia clarus, post mortem patris in Anglia
regnavit, rebelles sibi fortiter virga justitiæ compressit, et xii.
annis ac x. mensibus ad libitum suum omnes suæ ditioni subjugavit.
Militibus et exteris largus erat, sed pauperes incolas regni sui
nimis opprimebat, et illis violenter auferebat quæ prodigus advenis
tribuebat. Multi sub ipso patris sui proceres obierunt, qui proavis
suis extraneum jus bellicose vendicaverunt, pro quibus nonnullos
degeneres in locis magnatorum restituit, et amplis pro adulationis
merito datis honoribus sublimavit. Legitimam conjugem nunquam
habuit, sed obscœnis fornicationibus et frequentibus mœchiis inexplebiliter
inhæsit, flagitiisque pollutus exemplum turpis lasciviæ
subjectis damnabiliter exhibuit.”</p>

<p>There is also an earlier passage (669 A) which sets forth how
William kept the peace of the land. He records the surrender of
Rochester, and adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Omnium qui contra pacem enses acceperant nequam commotio
compressa est. Nam iniqui et omnes malefactores, ut audaciam
regis et fortitudinem viderunt, quia prædas et cædes aliaque facinora
cum aviditate amplexati fuerant, contremuerunt, nec postea
xii. annis quibus regnavit mutire ausi fuerunt. Ipse autem callide
se habuit et vindictæ tempus opportunum exspectavit.”</p>

<p>This of course refers to disturbers on a larger scale than common
robbers. But one law applied to all. King William kept down
all evil-doers, save himself and his own company.</p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon (<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 22) mainly translates the Chronicle;
but he adds some touches of his own, and strengthens some of
the epithets, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“invisus rex nequissimus et Deo et populo,”</span> <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> His
general picture is;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nec respirare potuit Anglia miserabiliter suffocata. Cum
autem omnia raperent et subverterent qui regi famulabantur, ita
ut adulteria violenter et impune committerent, quicquid antea
<a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a><span class="pageno">496</span>
nequitiæ pullulaverat in perfectum excrevit, et quicquid antea non
fuerat his temporibus pullulavit.”</p>

<p>He makes also, improving the words of the Chronicler, an important
addition;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quicquid Deo Deumque diligentibus displicebat hoc regi regemque
diligentibus placebat. Nec luxuriæ scelus tacendum
exercebant occulte, sed ex impudentia coram sole.”</p>

<p>This represents the English words (<abbr title="Peterborough Chronicle">Chron. Petrib.</abbr> 1100), “And
þeah þe ic hit lang ylde, eall þet þe Gode wæs lað and rihtfulle
mannan, eall þæt wæs gewunelic on þisan lande on his tyman.”</p>

<p>Somewhat later again the discerning William of Newburgh (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 2)
thus paints the Red King;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Factum est ut … Willelmus in principio infirmius laboriosiusque
imperaret, et ad conciliandos sibi animos subditorum modestior
mitiorque appareret. At postquam, perdomitis hostibus et fratre
mollius agente, roboratum est regnum ejus, exaltatum est illico cor
ejus, apparuitque, succedentibus prosperis, qualis apud se latuisset
dum premeretur adversis. Homo vecors et inconstans in omnibus
viis suis; Deo indevotus et ecclesiæ gravis, nuptiarum spernens
et passim lasciviens, opes regni vanissima effusione exhauriens, et
eisdem deficientibus subditorum fortunas in hoc ipsum corradens.
Homo typo immanissimæ superbiæ turgidus, et usque ad nauseam
vel etiam derisionem doctrinæ evangelicæ, temporalis gloriæ fœdissima
voluptate absorptus.”</p>

<p>This description, after all, is very much that of William of
Malmesbury translated into less courtly language. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“magnanimitas”</span>
has now fully developed into <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“immanissima superbia.”</span></p>

<p class="p2">From putting together all these descriptions we get the portrait
of William Rufus as one of those tyrants who keep a monopoly
of tyranny for themselves and their immediate servants. He puts
down other offenders, and strictly keeps the general peace of the
land. His justice, in the technical sense, is strong, with of course
the special exceptions hinted at by William of Malmesbury (see
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 143). There is no charge of cruelty in his own person; but
he allows his immediate followers, his courtiers and mercenaries,
to do any kind of wrong without punishment. He oppresses the
nation at large by exactions for the pay of his mercenaries. He
is withal a warlike and chivalrous king. We must take in the full
<a name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a><span class="pageno">497</span>
sense of phrases like <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“militiam diligens,”</span> which mean more than
simply “warlike;” the technical sense of “miles” and “militia”
often comes in. He was bountiful to his mercenaries, and generally
lavish. He was renowned for a quality called “magnanimitas.”
He was irreligious and blasphemous. Lastly, he and his immediate
company were noticed for specially foul lives, of a kind, it would
seem, out-doing the every-day vices of mankind.</p>

<p>Some of these points call for a more special notice. The “magnanimitas”
of William of Malmesbury is not exactly “magnanimity”
in the modern sense, which generally means a certain grand
and stately kind of mercy. The magnanimous man nowadays
chiefly shows his magnanimity, not so much in forgiving wrongs
as in passing them by without notice; they have hardly moved
him enough for forgiveness to come in. There is something approaching
to this in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“magnanimitas Willelmi”</span> (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 309) shown
to the knight who unhorsed him before Saint Michael’s Mount
(see <a href="#Page_289"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 289</a>). But the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“præclara magnanimitas”</span> (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 320) shown in
his voyage to Touques is of another kind. Then it is that we have
the wonderful comparison, or rather identification of William Rufus
and Cæsar, of which more in a later note (see <a href="#Note_PP">Note PP</a>). William
of Malmesbury clearly means the word for praise; and it is at least
not meant for dispraise when Suger, at the beginning of his life
of Lewis (Duchèsne, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 283), speaks of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“egregie magnanimus rex
Anglorum Guillelmus, magnanimioris Guillelmi regis filius Anglorum
domitoris.”</span> But the word seems to have reached a bad
sense when (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 302) Count Odo is called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“tumultuosus, <em>miræ
magnanimitatis</em>, caput sceleratorum”</span> (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 74).
And it is surely a fault, though it seems to be recorded with
admiration, that the first Percy who held Alnwick <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“fuit vir
magnanimus, quia noluit injuriam pati ab aliquo sine gravi vindicta”</span>
(see the Chronicle of Alnwick in the second volume of
the Archæological Institute at Newcastle, Appendix, <abbr title="page five">p. v</abbr>). And,
as it is not exactly our “magnanimous,” neither is it exactly
the <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="megalopsychos">μεγαλόψυχος</span> of Aristotle (<abbr title="Ethics four">Eth. iv.</abbr> 3)&mdash;<span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="ho megalôn auton axiôn axios ôn">ὁ μεγάλων αὐτὸν ἀξιῶν ἄξιος ὤν</span>
axios ôn&mdash;though it comes nearer to it. William of Malmesbury’s
“magnanimus” is perhaps Aristotle’s <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="megalopsychos">μεγαλόψυχος</span> verging towards
the <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="chaunos">χαῦνος</span>. The essence of the character is self-esteem,
self-confidence; a step will change him from William’s “magnanimus”
into Orderic’s “turgidus.” And this comes pretty much
<a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a><span class="pageno">498</span>
to the <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="tetyphômenos">τετυφωμένος</span> of the New Testament (2 <abbr title="Timothy three">Tim. iii.</abbr> 4), who is
not unlike William Rufus, only that he has at least a <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="morphôsis
eusebeias">μόρφωσις εὐσεβείας</span>. Here our version has “high-minded”&mdash;&#8203;the Revised
Version has “puffed up”&mdash;&#8203;just as in the departed service for
January 30 the slayers of Charles the First were called “high-minded”
by those who certainly did not mean to praise them.
This again is not quite the “magnanimitas” with which we have
to do, which is still a virtue, though a dangerous one. Perhaps we
may say that William the King really was “high-minded” in this
sense, and that William the monk used a slightly ambiguous word,
in order to pass him off for “high-minded” in the other sense.</p>

<p class="p2">The mercenary soldiers, the excesses wrought by them, and the
extortion by which their pay and largesse were supplied, all come
out in the words of the Chronicler that the land was vexed “mid
here and mid ungylde.” That they were chiefly foreigners appears
from Orderic’s phrase “advenæ,” which is doubtless opposed, not
only to the “Angli naturales,” but to the companions of the Conqueror
and their sons. The “advenæ” are opposed to the “incolæ,”
whether the “incolæ” have been settled for one generation or
twenty. So says William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 314);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Excitabat ergo totum occidentem fama largitatis ejus, orientem
usque pertendens; veniebant ad eum milites ex omni quæ citra
montes est provincia, quos ipse profusissimis expensis munerabat;
itaque cum defecisset quod daret, inops et exhaustus ad lucra convertit
animum.”</p>

<p>Of their doings he tells us that, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“soluta militari disciplina,
curiales rusticorum substantias depascebantur, insumebant fortunas.”</span>
But the fullest account of their misdeeds is that given by Eadmer
(<abbr title="Historia novorum">Hist. Nov.</abbr> 94), when he records the statute passed by Henry, when
he and Anselm give their minds <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“qualiter aliquo modo mala quæ
pauperes maxime deprimebant mitigarentur.”</span></p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tempore siquidem fratris sui regis hunc morem multitudo
eorum qui curiam ejus sequebantur habebat, ut quæque pessumdarent,
diriperent, et, nulla eos cohibente disciplina, totam
terram per quam rex ibat devastarent. Accedebat his aliud
malum; plurimi namque eorum sua malitia debriati dum reperta
in hospitiis quæ invadebant, penitus absumere non valebant, ea
aut ad forum per eosdem ipsos quorum erant pro suo lucro ferre et
<a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"></a><span class="pageno">499</span>
vendere, aut supposito igne cremare, aut si potus esset, lotis exinde
equorum suorum pedibus, residuum illius per terram effundere, aut
certe alio aliquo modo disperdere solebant. Quæ vero in patres-familias
crudelia, quæ in uxores et filias eorum indecentia, fecerint,
reminisci pudet. Has ob causas quiqui, præcognito regis adventu,
sua habitacula fugiebant, sibi suisque quantum valebant in silvis
vel aliis locis in quibus se tutari posse sperebant, consulentes.”</p>

<p>Here doubtless the misdeeds of courtiers, soldiers, and camp-followers,
are all mixed together; but all were in the train of
the King. In short, the march of the second William through
his own kingdom must have done at least as much harm as the
march of the first William when he was only seeking to make
it his kingdom. All these horrors undoubtedly fell on the native
English more heavily than on anybody else; only I see no reason to
think that, when the houses of a small English and a small Norman
landowner, or the houses of the English and Norman tenants of a
great landowner, stood near together, the Norman house would be
respected, while the English house was plundered. The plunderers
would hardly touch the house of Thurkill of Warwick any more
than that of Roger of Ivry; but, among their smaller neighbours,
William and Matilda would hardly fare better than Godric and
Godgifu. Indeed William of Malmesbury a little further on (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 319)
speaks of the general oppression of Rufus as one that touched all
classes, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Non pauperem tenuitas, non opulentum copia, tuebatur.”</span></p>

<p>The mercenaries of the days of Rufus forestall the mercenaries of
the days of Stephen and John; but, unless we are to reckon a man
of the rank of Walter Tirel, we do not get such a clear notion of
any particular persons among them. The phrase of Orderic, in one
of the passages already quoted (see above, <a href="#Page_495"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 495</a>), about the promotion
of “degeneres” in the room of the nobles of the Conqueror’s
day might make us think that some of them were put in high
places. But no such instances seem to be recorded. And the word
“restituit” might suggest the restoration of native Englishmen, a
process which may really (see <a href="#Page_88"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 88</a>) have happened to some
extent after the suppression of the rebellion in 1088. But
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ordericus Angligena”</span> would never speak of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Angli naturales”</span>
as “degeneres.”</p>

<p class="p2">The dress, manners, and morals of the court of William Rufus
<a name="Page_500" id="Page_500"></a><span class="pageno">500</span>
stand out clearly in several descriptions. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tunc effeminati passim
in orbe dominabantur”</span> says Orderic (682 B, <abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> 781 D), following
the remark with stronger and plainer words. He is eloquent on
their womanish fashion of dressing and wearing the hair;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ritus heroum abjiciebant, hortamenta sacerdotum deridebant,
barbaricumque morem in habitu et vita tenebant. Nam capillos a
vertice in frontem discriminabant, longos crines velut mulieres nutriebant
et summopere curabant, prolixisque nimiumque strictis camisiis
indui tunicisque gaudebant. Omne tempus quidam usurpabant, et
extra legem Dei moremque patrium pro libitu suo ducebant….
In diebus istis veterum ritus pene totus novis adinventionibus commutatus
est. Femineam mollitiem petulans juventus amplectitur,
feminisque viri curiales in omni lascivia summopere adulantur….
Humum pulverulentam interularum et palliorum superfluo scirmate
verrunt, longis latisque manicis ad omnia facienda manus operiunt;
et his superfluitatibus onusti celeriter ambulare vel aliquid utiliter
operari vix possunt. Sincipite scalciati sunt ut fures, occipite
autem prolixas nutriunt comas ut meretrices…. Crispant crines
calamistro. Caput velant vitta sine pileo. Vix aliquis militarium
procedit in publicum capite discooperto legitimeque secundum
apostoli præceptum tonso.”</p>

<p>Yet, with all this aping of female manners, the gallants of
Rufus’ court did in one respect follow the law of masculine nature
more closely than their immediate <em>antecessores</em>, either Norman or
English;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nunc pene universi populares cerriti sunt et barbatuli, palam
manifestantes specimine tali quod sordibus libidinis gaudent, ut
fœtentes hirci.”</p>

<p>Bishop Serlo in the sermon (816 A, B) enlarges on this last comparison
with much greater strength of language; and brings in
another likeness, and a reason which certainly has an odd
sound;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Barbas suas radere devitant, ne pili suas in osculis amicas
præcisi pungant, et setosi Saracenos magis se quam Christianos
simulant.”</p>

<p>Seemingly the shaving of the ancient heroes of Normandy was
but rare, perhaps weekly, like the bath of their Danish forefathers
(see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume one page">N. C. vol. i. p.</abbr> 651).</p>

<p>Of the long hair, and what Anselm thought of it, we hear again
<a name="Page_501" id="Page_501"></a><span class="pageno">501</span>
in the course of our story (see <a href="#Page_449"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 449</a>). William of Malmesbury
also (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 314) has his say about the courtiers;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tunc fluxus crinium, tunc luxus vestium, tunc usus calceorum
cum arcuatis aculeis inventus; mollitie corporis certare cum feminis,
gressum frangere, gestu soluto et latere nudo incedere, adolescentium
specimen erat. Enerves, emolliti, quod nati fuerant inviti manebant,
expugnatores alienæ pudicitiæ, prodigi suæ. Sequebantur
curiam effeminatorum manus et ganearum greges.”</p>

<p>A various reading in a note in Sir T. D. Hardy’s edition is
stronger still.</p>

<p>In the Life of Wulfstan (Anglia Sacra, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 254) William tells us
of the strictness of that saint in this matter, in which he gave
Bishop Serlo his model;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ille vitiosos, et præsertim eos qui crinem pascerent, insectari,
quorum si qui sibi verticem supponerent, ipse suis manibus comam
lascivientem secaret. Habebat ad hoc parvum cultellum, quo vel
excrementa unguium vel sordes librorum purgare consueverat.
Hoc cæsariei libabat primitias, injungens per obedientiam, ut capillorum
ceterorum series ad eandem complanarentur concordiam.
Si qui repugnandum putarent, eis palam exprobrare mollitiem,
palam mala minari.”</p>

<p>But it is rather hard when William of Malmesbury forgets that
all this belongs to the last years of Wulfstan’s episcopate and not to
the first, and when he goes on to say that the fashion of wearing long
hair led to a decay of military prowess in England, and thereby to
the Norman Conquest. This can be paralleled only with those
astounding notions of Matthew Paris about our beards which I
have spoken of in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 686.</p>

<p>As the practice could be put down for a moment only, whether
by Wulfstan, Anselm, or Serlo, William has to come back to it
again in the Historia Novella, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 4, where he tells of a momentary
reform in 1129. See Sir T. D. Hardy’s note.</p>

<p>Some of these descriptions carry us back to earlier times, as to
the picture of the “molles” at Carthage down to Saint Augustine’s
day (<abbr title="Civitate Dei, seven">Civ. Dei, vii.</abbr> 26), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“qui usque in hesternum diem madidis
capillis, facie dealbata, fluentibus membris, incessu femineo, per
plateas vicosque Carthaginis etiam a populis unde turpiter viverent
exigebant”</span> (only the “molles” of the Red King’s day took what
they would by force). <abbr title="Compare">Cf.</abbr> Lucan, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 164;</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<a name="Page_502" id="Page_502"></a><span class="pageno">502</span>
<div class="i2">“Cultus gestare decoros</div>
<div class="i0">Vix nuribus rapuere mares.”</div>
</div>

<p>About the shoes much has been written, and the fashion, in one
shape or another, seems to have lasted for several ages. Orderic
is quite as wrathful at this seemingly harmless folly, as he is at
the other evil fashions which seem more serious. But perhaps the
force lies in the passage where he says (682 C), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Pedum articulis,
<em>ubi finis est corporis</em>, colubrinarum similitudinem caudarum imponunt,
quas velut scorpiones præ oculis suis prospiciunt.”</span> The
practice seems to have been looked on as a profane attempt to
improve the image of God, an argument which surely told no less
strongly against the practice of the ancient heroes when they shaved
themselves. With Count Fulk (682 A) one cannot help feeling
some sympathy. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quia pedes habebat deformes, instituit sibi fieri
longos et in summitate acutissimos subtolares, ita ut operiret pedes,
et eorum celaret tubera quæ vulgo vocantur uniones.”</span> Yet this is
very gravely set down among his many evil deeds. Then seemingly
another stage took place, when (682 B) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Robertus quidam nebulo
in curia Rufi regis prolixas pigacias primus cepit implere stuppis,
et hinc inde contorquere instar cornu arietis. Ob hoc ipse Cornardus
cognominatus est.”</span></p>

<p class="p2">A number of hints in the above passages seem to show us that
the vices of Rufus were literally the works of darkness, works
which even his own more outspoken age shrank from dwelling on
in detail. It is hardly a metaphor when Orderic says (680 A),
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In diebus illis lucerna veræ sanctitatis obscurius micabat.”</span> For,
among the reforms of Henry the First (<abbr title="William of Malmesbury five">Will. Malms. v.</abbr> 393), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“effeminatos
curia propellens, lucernarum usum noctibus in curia restituit,
qui fuerat tempore fratris intermissus.”</span> That Henry the
First could be looked on as a moral reformer is the best sign of
what he had to reform. Henry, with his crowd of mistresses and
bastards, is described as loathing the profligacies (“obscœnitates,” a
word which seems used in a special sense) of his brother (<abbr title="William of Malmsbury four">Will.
Malms. iv.</abbr> 314, and specially the wonderful passage, <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 412, as to
the force of which there can be no doubt), and as making it his
first business on his accession to clear the court of its foulest
abuses. (<abbr title="Compare">Cf.</abbr> Mrs. Hutchinson’s account of Charles the First’s reforms,
<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 127.) We must remember that no mistresses or children
<a name="Page_503" id="Page_503"></a><span class="pageno">503</span>
of Rufus are mentioned or hinted at. Orderic’s phrase of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“mœchus
rex”</span> is quite vague, perhaps euphemistic, and when the Welsh
chronicler (<abbr title="Annales Cambriae">Ann. Camb.</abbr> 1100) says that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“concubinis usus, sine
liberis obiit,”</span> he may be sheltering himself under an ambiguous
word. In the Chronicle of Hugh of Flavigny (Pertz, <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 496) is a
strange legend of what the writer truly calls <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“inauditum seculis omnibus
monstrum,”</span> but one which could not have been devised except
in the state of things which William of Malmesbury and Eadmer
describe. After all (see <abbr title="Henry of Huntingdon seven">Hen. Hunt. vii.</abbr> 32; <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 195),
the reform wrought by Henry seems to have been only for a season.
It is some slight comfort to hear from the mouth of Anselm, in his
first protest to the King (Eadmer, <abbr title="Historia novorum">Hist. Nov.</abbr> 24), that the presence
of Eastern vices in England was something <a name="line503_13" id="line503_13"></a>new&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“noviter in hac
terram divulgatum.”</span></p>

<p class="p2">Of the blasphemies of William Rufus several instances have been
given in the text. He had also, like everybody else of his time, his
own special oath. As his father swore <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“par la resplendar Dé,”</span> as
other kings swore <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“per oculos Dei,” “per pedes Dei,” “per
dentes Dei,”</span> William Rufus swears (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“sic enim jurabat,”</span> says William
of Malmesbury, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 309) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“per vultum Dei,”</span> or more commonly
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“per vultum de Luca.”</span> Some of the older writers oddly
mistook this for an oath by Saint Luke’s face. But the true
meaning of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“vultus de Luca”</span> was long ago explained by
Ducange under the word “vultus,” where he refers to the then
manuscript <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Otia Imperialia”</span> of Gervase of Tilbury, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 24,
which will be found in Leibnitz’s collection of Brunswick writers,
<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 967. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“vultus Lucanus”</span> was held to have been made
by Nicodemus from the impression of our Lord’s face taken on
linen immediately after the crucifixion. This it was by which
the Red King swore. In French the oath takes the form <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Li vo
de Luche”</span> (Roman de Rou, line 14920). <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Charles de Rémusat
(<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anselme de Cantorbéry, 133) remarks, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Il se peut même que
ce ne soit pas précisément celui de Lucques; car on appela Saint
Voult-de-Lucques, vulgairement et par corruption Saint Godeln,
tout crucifix habillé semblable à celui-là tel que ceux qu’on voyait
jadis à Saint-Etienne-de-Sens, au Sépulcre à Paris.”</span> But it is
strange that Lappenberg (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte von England</span>, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 172), when
telling the story of the Red King’s “magnanimitas” before Saint
<a name="Page_504" id="Page_504"></a><span class="pageno">504</span>
Michael’s Mount (see <a href="#Page_289"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 289</a> and <a href="#Note_N">Appendix N</a>), brings in the oath
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“per vultum de Luca”</span> in Wace’s story, where it is not found,
in the form <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“bei dem heiligen Antlitz zu Lucca,”</span> and afterwards
in William of Malmesbury’s story in the form <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“bei <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucca’s
Antlitz.”</span></p>

<p class="center sc">The Ecclesiastical Benefactions of William Rufus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I think</span> that an examination of the cases in which William
Rufus has the credit of an ecclesiastical benefactor will show
that in most of them, if not in all, there is a direct or implied
reference to the memory of his father. In the case of Battle and
Saint Stephen’s this is plain on the surface. Of his moveable gifts to
Battle some have been mentioned already (see <a href="#Page_18"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 18</a>); he also gave
(<abbr title="Chronicon">Chron.</abbr> de Bello, 40) considerable gifts in real property, specially
the royal manor of Bromham in Wiltshire, valued at forty pounds
yearly. One year’s income then was to be got back by converting
the young Jew back to Judaism (see <a href="#Page_163"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 163</a>). At the dedication
of Battle he gave (<abbr title="Chronicon">Chron.</abbr> de Bello, 41; <abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum three">Mon. Angl. iii.</abbr> 246) a
number of churches, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pro anima patris mei regis Willielmi, et
matris et omnium parentum nostrorum qui ibi in bello ceciderunt,
et aliorum omnium.”</span> The local writer, who records none of his
evil deeds, gives him this character (42);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tantopere memoratus rex eandem amabat, excolebat, tuebaturque
ecclesiam, ejusque dignitates et regales consuetudines conservabat,
ut quemadmodum patris ejus tempore nullus ei adeo
adversari præsumeret, ipse quoque quotiens casu vicinia peteret,
ex dilectionis abundantia sæpius eam revisere, fovere, et consolari
solitus fuerat.”</p>

<p>As for Saint Stephen’s, there is a charter in Neustria Pia, 638,
of William Rufus of 1088 granting various lands in England,
among them Coker in Somerset and Wells in Norfolk, with
the church of Corsham in Wiltshire and other tithes. The signatures
show that it is very carelessly copied or printed; but among
them is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmus cancellarius,”</span> that is, William Giffard, afterwards
Bishop of Winchester; <a href="#Page_349">see <abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 349</a>. We read how
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“glorioso patri gloriosus filius Willelmus in regnum successit,”</span>
<a name="Page_505" id="Page_505"></a><span class="pageno">505</span>
and how he made his gifts, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“prædicti cœnobii utilitati prospiciens,
habito procerum et religiosarum personarum Angliæ et Normanniæ
consilio.”</span></p>

<p>The Waltham writer (De Inv. c. 22) has another way of looking
at things. Of the Conqueror he speaks most respectfully, but adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Successit ei filius Willelmus Ruphus cognomento, hæres quidem
beneficiorum, sed degener morum, cui breves annos credimus indultos,
quia concessis sibi beneficiis a Domino minus aptus nec
ecclesiæ devotus sicut expediret, nec justitiæ strenuus executor, sed
vir desideriorum eisque indulgens semper exstitit.”</p>

<p>The wrongs which Rufus did to Waltham are told with great
fervour of declamation; and specially why he did them, namely,</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Vilia censens Anglorum instituta, nec eousque valitura quin eis
eligeret ditare prædecessorum sepulturas, et ecclesiam Cadomensem
ex rapina ornare, et spoliis Walthamensis ecclesiæ salubre remedium
credens animarum patris et matris ibi quiescentium, si de alieno et
quasi ab uno altari distracto aliud ornatur, et quasi munus gratum
et valde preciosum alicui patri offerantur præcisa proprii membra
filii.”</p>

<p>The words about English customs are meant, with whatever
truth, to contrast William the Red with his father, who is praised
for observing them. The plunder transferred from Waltham to
Caen consisted of moveable wealth of every kind, among other
things books, valued altogether at the incredible sum of 6666
pounds. The King afterwards repented, and, though the spoil
stayed in the two minsters at Caen, he gave back, after the death
of Bishop William of Durham (who is confounded with Walcher),
that is in 1096 or later, during the vacancy, the lands which had
been given to the bishopric (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 664). Dr. Stubbs
(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 50) prints a writ of William Rufus addressed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“vicecomitibus
suis et ministris</span> [þegnas],” confirming to the canons of Waltham all
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“terras suas et consuetudines”</span> which they held in his father’s time.
It is a mere writ; but it must, as Dr. Stubbs suggests, be the occasion
of the burst of joy in <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 23;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Laudamus præsentem hunc Willelmum, qui ob reconciliandam
sibi crucifixi gratiam quam offendisse plurimum non dubitamus in
hujus perpetratione spoliationis, qui eam carta sua ecclesiæ confirmavit,
et sub prædicto anathematis edicto, assistentibus archiepiscopis,
episcopis, et universo clero, communiter roboravit.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506"></a><span class="pageno">506</span>
Dr. Stubbs (De Inv. 14) suggests, with great likelihood, that this
robbery of the moveable wealth of Waltham was not done for the
enriching of Saint Stephen’s, but that it was part of the general
robbery of all churches to pay the price of Normandy in 1096
(see <a href="#Page_358"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 358</a>). And this is the more likely, because the 6666 pounds
(= 10,000 marks) said to have been taken from Waltham was
actually the sum paid to Robert. The Waltham writer has made
some confusion in his reckoning. Still the general picture of
the Red King robbing Waltham and enriching Caen holds good.
For we have seen that he was a benefactor to Saint Stephen’s, and
the writ seems to imply some meddling with the lands, as well as
the treasures, of Waltham.</p>

<p class="p2">The curious story about the hospital of Saint Peter, afterwards
Saint Leonard, at York, all about Æthelstan and the Culdees, and
the grant of the thrave of corn which became memorable in the
fifteenth century (see Lingard, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 163), will be found in the local
history in the Monasticon, <abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 608. We read how the Conqueror
confirmed everything, and then&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmus Rufus, filius Conquestoris prædicti, rex immediate
succedens, fundavit seu mutavit situm dicti hospitalis in locum
regium ubi nunc situatur,… et dedit et confirmavit dictas travas
hospitali prædicto, sicut fecit pater ejus Conquestor.”</p>

<p>So Leland speaks of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Gulielmus junior, rex Angliæ, fundator
hospitalis, qui etiam ecclesiolam ibidem construxit et S. Petro
dedicavit.”</span></p>

<p>So the hospital of God’s House at Thetford is attributed to
William Rufus, <abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum seven">Mon. Angl. vii.</abbr> 769. He is also said to have
founded the nunnery of Armethwaite in Cumberland, and the
foundation charter is printed in the Monasticon, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 270. But
it is spurious on the face of it. The date given is January 6,
1089; yet Rufus is made to give grants in Carlisle which he
did not yet possess, and to call himself <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“dux Normannorum.”</span>
He appears too in the Abingdon History, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 26, 284, as granting
the church of Sutton to the abbey of Abingdon on the petition of
Abbot Reginald. The grant has three somewhat characteristic
witnesses, Robert Fitz-hamon, Robert the Chancellor, that is
Robert Bloet, and our old friend Croc the Hunter.</p>

<p>He is also called a benefactor to the church of Rochester; but
<a name="Page_507" id="Page_507"></a><span class="pageno">507</span>
it is not clear that he actually gave anything of his own cost. In
the local histories (<abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum one">Mon. Angl. i.</abbr> 161, 162, 174) we read that Rufus
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“reddidit et restituit Lamhethe et dedit Hedenham ecclesiæ Roffæ;”
“dedit Lamtheam [hetham] et Aedenham ad victum monachorum,”</span>
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 163 is his writ granting the manor of Stone to the church
of Saint Andrew and Bishop Gundulf; and in 173, 174 he grants
Lambeth and Hedenham. But Henry’s charter in the same page
speaks of Lambeth and Hedenham as gifts of Bishop Gundulf to the
monks, and in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 165 Stone is held by Ralph the son, and Osmund
the son-in-law, of Gilbert, who becomes a monk at Rochester.
The brothers find the King a harsh lord (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ambo regis exactionibus
tantum fuerunt gravati ut vix amplius hoc possent ferre. Erant
enim illis diebus consuetudines regis gravissimæ atque durissimæ
per totum regnum Angliæ”</span>); they therefore suggest that the
Bishop should get the manor of the King, and they will hold it
of him. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quo audito, episcopus quam citius potuit regem impigre
adiit, amicorum itaque apud regem usus auxilio, tandem
obtinuit quod petiit; dedit ergo episcopus Willielmo regi,
magni regis Willielmi filio, <abbr title="15">xv.</abbr> libras denariorum et unam mulam
quæ bene valebat <abbr title="100">c.</abbr> solidos.”</span> Ralph and Osmund become the
Bishop’s men for the manor&mdash;&#8203;a very good case of round-about
commendation&mdash;&#8203;but presently, by an exchange of lands between
them and the Bishop, Stone becomes a direct possession of the see.
We have also heard something about Hedenham in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr>
366, and William of Malmesbury also (<abbr title="Gestis Pontificum">Gest. Pont.</abbr> 137) speaks of it
as bought by Gundulf&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ex suo villam coemptam.”</span> Lambeth may
have been a free gift. It afterwards, as all the world knows, passed
by exchange to the see of Canterbury.</p>

<p>There is a very curious document in the Monasticon (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 497) from
the cartulary of Tavistock in which Rufus&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“inclitæ recordationis
secundus Guillielmus”</span>&mdash;&#8203;confirms in 1096 to the abbey a manor,
Wlurintun, which some said belonged to the crown. The grant
of course takes the form of a gift. But the only thing which Rufus
really seems to have given was an ivory knife, a symbol which is
also met with in other cases;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sciant omnes quod rex per cultellum eburneum quod in manu
tenuit et abbati porrexit hoc donum peregit apud curiam … qui
quidem cultellus jacet in feretro sancti Rumoni.”</p>

<p>The witnesses are Bishop Walkelin of Winchester, Bishop John
<a name="Page_508" id="Page_508"></a><span class="pageno">508</span>
of Bath, and Abbot Thurstan of Glastonbury. The demand had
been made before commissioners sent in Lent to Devonshire,
Cornwall, and Exeter&mdash;&#8203;the local capital stands apart&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ad investiganda
regalia placita.”</span> They were Bishop Walkelin, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Randulfus
capellanus”</span> (Flambard), William <em>Capra</em> (see him in Domesday,
110, as <em>Chievre</em>; he is <em>Capra</em> in Exon), and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hardinus Belnoldi
filius.”</span> Is not “Belnoldus,” a strange name, a miswriting for
<em>Ednodus</em>? See <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 756.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have elsewhere seen (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest four">N. C. iv.</abbr> 411) that William
granted the manor of Bermondsey to the foundation of the Englishman
Ælfwine Child. See the charter in Monasticon, <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 100. It is
witnessed by the founder Ælfwine, also, between the bishops and
Eudo <em>dapifer</em>, by “Johannes de Sumbresetta.” Is this the Bishop
of Bath, not yet used to his new title?</p>

<p class="p2">A crowd of writs securing churches in rights already possessed,
as well as simple confirmations of the grants of others, do not
bear upon the matter. And we must not forget that he showed
a degree of tenderness to the monks of Durham during the banishment
of their bishop (see <a href="#Page_299"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 299</a>) which he failed to show to
other monks. Still, in any case, the gifts of William Rufus make a
poor show between the gifts of the founder of Battle and those
of the founder of Reading.</p>

<p class="center sc">Chivalry.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I refer</span> to the remarkable passage of Sir Francis Palgrave,
Normandy and England, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 438;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Are we not told that ‘the Spirit of Chivalry was the parent
and offspring of the Crusades?’ again that in ‘the accomplished
character of the Crusader we discover all the virtues of a perfect
Knight, the true Spirit of Chivalry, which inspired the generous
sentiments and social offices of man?’&mdash;&#8203;the Historian might reply
in the words of a great Teacher, whose voice already resounds in
History&mdash;&#8203;‘I confess that if I were called upon to name what Spirit
of evil predominantly deserved the name of Antichrist, I should
name the Spirit of Chivalry: the more detestable for the very
<a name="Page_509" id="Page_509"></a><span class="pageno">509</span>
guise of the Archangel ruined, which has made it so seductive
to the most generous spirits&mdash;&#8203;but to me so hateful, because it is
in direct opposition to the impartial justice of the Gospel, and
its comprehensive feeling of equal brotherhood, and because it so
fostered a sense of honour rather than a sense of duty.’… Take
the huge folio of the <cite>Gesta Dei per Francos</cite>&mdash;&#8203;search it boldly and
honestly, turn over its fifteen hundred pages, examine their contents
according to the rules of moral evidence, the praises the Writers
bestow, and more than their praises, their blame; their commentaries
upon deeds of cruelty, and more than their commentaries, their
silence&mdash;&#8203;and try how much you can extract which will justify any
one of the general positions which the popular enthusiasts for
Chivalry have maintained.”</p>

<p>The extract is from a letter of Arnold to Archdeacon Hare in
1829 (Life and Correspondence, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 255). A note adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“‘Chivalry,’ or (as he used more frequently to call the element
in the middle ages which he thus condemned) ‘feudality,’ is
especially Keltic and barbarian&mdash;&#8203;incompatible with the highest
virtue of which man is capable, and the last at which he arrives&mdash;&#8203;a
sense of justice. It sets up the personal allegiance to the chief
above allegiance to God and law.”</p>

<p>Nothing can be better; only it is not quite clear what Arnold
meant by “Keltic;” continental chivalry must be carefully distinguished
from devotion to the chief of the clan, though there
is much analogy between the two feelings. But, as I have said
elsewhere (<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 483), chivalry is Norman rather than
English and French rather than Norman; so in that sense it may
be called “Keltic.”</p>

<p>Sir Francis Palgrave goes on to discuss one of the stories of
the boasted generosity of Bayard. Like some others, it merely
comes to this, that he did not act a part which would have been
singularly shameful.</p>

<p>About chivalry and other kindred matters, I had my own say
in an article on the Law of Honour in the Fortnightly Review,
December 1876. But I must decline to pledge myself to Sir
F. Palgrave’s condemnation of the crusades. All that he says
is perfectly true of the crimes and follies in detail with which
the crusades were disgraced. And in those days it would have
been hard to carry out a crusade without a large measure of those
<a name="Page_510" id="Page_510"></a><span class="pageno">510</span>
crimes and follies. And this might be in itself a fair argument,
though not one which the age would have understood, against undertaking
any crusade at all. But I must hold that the general
idea of the crusade itself was something high above all chivalry.
I must hold that all the crusades before the fourth, whatever we
say of the way in which they were carried out, were in themselves
fully justifiable, both in morality and in policy. Surely, in all
that bears on this matter, it is Cohen rather than Palgrave that
speaks. With all his learning and acuteness, with all his lofty
and Christian morality, his deep and wide-reaching sympathy with
right and hatred of wrong in every shape, my illustrious predecessor
in Norman and English history was still, as a man of the East,
unable thoroughly to throw himself into the Western side of a
great struggle between East and West.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Purchase of the Côtentin by the Ætheling
Henry.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> told this part of my story as I find it in Orderic, whose
account seems to me to be probable, and to hang well together,
while it is confirmed, not indeed in every detail, but in its leading
outlines, by the account in the Continuation of William of Jumièges;
that is, by Robert of Torigny. But William of Malmesbury and
Wace give quite different versions. That of William is found, not
in the part of his work where he records the events of the reign of
William Rufus, but at the beginning of his fifth book (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 392),
where he introduces the reign of Henry with a sketch of his earlier
life. While the rebellion of 1088 is going on in England, and while
Robert is waiting&mdash;&#8203;waiting, our historian says, for a favourable
wind&mdash;&#8203;to go to help his supporters there, Henry, by the Duke’s
order, goes away into Britanny (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Henricus in Britanniam ejus jussu
abscesserat”</span>). Meanwhile Robert spends on his mercenaries the
money which the Conqueror had left to Henry, which is here cut
down from 5000 pounds to 3000 <em>marks</em>&mdash;&#8203;a mistake partly arising
from a confusion between the whole sum left to Henry and the sum
paid for the Côtentin (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ille, occasione aucupata, omnem illam
pecuniarum vim testamento patris adolescentulo legatam, quæ erat</span>
<a name="Page_511" id="Page_511"></a><span class="pageno">511</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">trium millium marcarum, in stipendiarios suos absumpsit”</span>). Then
follows a very confused story, how Henry came back and passed
over the wrong in silence (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Henricus reversus, licet forsitan ægre
tulisset, taciturna præteriit industria”</span>); the reason given being
the restoration of peace in England (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“enimvero, nuntiata pacis
compositione in Anglia, deposita militia ferias armis dedere”</span>). He
then goes away into some quarter where the Duke had given or
promised him lands, but he is at the same time entrusted with the
keeping of the castle of Rouen (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“comes in sua, junior in ea quæ
frater suus dederat vel promiserat, discessit; namque et in acceptum
promissa referebat, custodiens turrim Rotomagi in ejus fidelitatem.”</span>
Or can these last words mean that Henry kept the castle of Rouen
in pledge till the promised lands were actually put into his
hands?). Presently, on the accusation of some very bad people&mdash;&#8203;if
the Bishop of Bayeux was one of them, he is not mentioned by
name&mdash;&#8203;Henry is unjustly kept in ward for half a year in this same
tower of Rouen (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“delatione pessimorum cessit in adversum fidelitas,
et nulla sua culpa in ipso eodem loco Henricus libere custoditus
est, ne servatorum diligentiam</span> [who are the “servatores”?]
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">effugio luderet”</span>). Then he goes by William’s invitation to England,
and enters the King’s service; there William keeps him for a year,
making promises which he never fulfils. Robert meanwhile sends
a message promising redress, on the strength of which Henry goes
back to Normandy (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“post medium annum laxatus, fratri Willelmo
invitanti serviturum se obtulit; at ille, nihilo modestius ephebum
remunerans, plus anno inanibus sponsionibus agentem distulit.
Quapropter, Roberto emendationem facti per nuntios promittente,
Normanniam venit”</span>). There he was exposed to intrigues on the
part of both his brothers, which are very darkly described; but he
escapes from all danger, and, by seizing Avranches and some other
castles, compels Robert to make peace with him (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“amborum fratrum
expertus insidias; nam et rex, pro repulsa iratus, ut retineretur
frustra mandarat; et comes, accusatorum lenociniis mutatus, voluntatem
verterat ut blanditiis attrectatum non ita facile dimitteret.
Verum ille, Dei providentia et sagaci sua diligentia cuncta evadens
pericula, occupatione Abrincarum et quorundam castellorum coegit
fratrem libenter paci manum dedere”</span>). Then comes the invasion of
Normandy by William, the sedition at Rouen, the death of Conan
by Henry’s own hand (see <a href="#Page_257"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 257</a>). Robert then ungratefully drives
<a name="Page_512" id="Page_512"></a><span class="pageno">512</span>
Henry from the city (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“parum hic labor apud Robertum valuit,
virum animi mobilis, qui statim ad ingratitudinem flexus, bene
meritum urbe cedere coegit”</span>). Then, without any explanation,
comes the siege of Saint Michael’s Mount, which he had already described
elsewhere (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 308). Of Domfront and Saint James we hear
nothing.</p>

<p>There is in this account a greater attempt at chronological precision
than is usual with William of Malmesbury, especially when
he tells a story out of its chronological place. And the dates do
not hang badly together. Henry is put in ward late in 1088 for
six months. On his release he goes to England for a year, comes
back, and seizes Avranches. This brings us well into 1090, the year
of the vicarious invasion of Normandy by Rufus, of the sedition at
Rouen, and of the death of Conan. But these dates do not agree with
the more exact chronology of Orderic. According to him (672 D),
Henry went to England in the summer of 1088, and came back to
Normandy in the autumn of the same year (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In æstate, postquam
certus rumor de Rofensis deditione citra mare personuit … transfretavit
… deinde in auctumno regi valefecit”</span>). He is at once
imprisoned, and is released, as far as one can see, about February
1089. At least Orderic mentions his release as happening
about the same time as the death of Durand Abbot of Troarn, on
February 3 in that year (676 B, C). Moreover the order of events,
both with regard to the voyage and imprisonment, is altogether
changed, and the whole story is told in a different way from that
of Orderic. The story about Robert taking Henry’s money contradicts
the express statement of Orderic (659 D) that Henry had
put his money in safe keeping; it contradicts too the implied
statements of Orderic and all the other writers who describe the
cession of the Côtentin to Henry as a sale, or at least as a
pledge, as something in either case by which Henry paid down
money and received land. And it may be hard to reconcile William
of Malmesbury’s narrative here with his own statement
just before (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 391), that Henry was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“paterna benedictione et materna
hæreditate, simul et multiplicibus thesauris, nixus.”</span> Nor
has William of Malmesbury any distinct mention of the Côtentin,
or of any other possessions of Henry, till after his release from
prison. And then he represents Henry as obtaining them by
force, a story which most likely comes from some confusion
<a name="Page_513" id="Page_513"></a><span class="pageno">513</span>
with the later events, mentioned in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 286. The visit to Britanny
on the part of Henry which comes earlier in the story is most
likely his visit to Britanny after the siege of Saint Michael’s Mount
(see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 294) moved out of its place. The whole narrative is dark
and perplexed throughout, in marked contrast to the clear and
careful statement of Orderic. And among the points on which William
differs from Orderic the only one on which he is at all borne
out by any trustworthy authority is, as we shall presently see, that
by which he makes Rouen the place of Henry’s imprisonment.
Yet there are one or two points on which we might almost think
that William had some narrative like that of Orderic before him.
Though Robert gets possession of Henry’s money in different ways
in the two stories, yet in both he takes it for the same purpose,
that of paying his mercenaries. And there is a certain likeness in
the pictures which they both give of Henry as exposed to the enmity
of both his brothers at once. It is possible that William’s version
may really be an unsuccessful attempt to put together the detached
facts of Orderic’s story, not necessarily of Orderic’s text.</p>

<p>Wace tells the story in a yet more confused way than William
of Malmesbury, and with the events strangely transposed throughout.
But he gives one or two details, bringing in persons of whom we
hear elsewhere, which are likely enough to be authentic. When
Robert is planning the invasion of England, he wants money, and
for that end, pledges (14505&ndash;14520), not grants or sells, the Côtentin
to Henry.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Henris li a l’aveir presté,</div>
<div class="i0">Si come il li out demandé:</div>
<div class="i0">Costentin en gage reçut,</div>
<div class="i0">E tant lunges aveir le dut</div>
<div class="i0">Ke li dus li soen li rendist,</div>
<div class="i0">E del tot son gréant en fist.”</div>
</div>

<p>He adds that Richard of Reviers, or Redvers, left Robert’s service
for that of Henry, in answer to a special request made by Henry
to his brother. This is likely enough. Richard of Redvers appears
once in Domesday (Dorset 83), and his pedigree is set forth in a
special note by Mr. Stapleton (<abbr title="two 269">ii. cclxix</abbr>), who corrects the belief
(see Prevost on Wace, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 307; Ellis, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 377) that he was a son of
Baldwin of Exeter (see Norman Conquest, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 161). He appears
in Orderic (689 C) and the Continuation of William of Jumièges
(<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 4), along with Earl Hugh of Chester, as one of Henry’s supporters
in the Côtentin, and we see throughout that he was an
<a name="Page_514" id="Page_514"></a><span class="pageno">514</span>
important person in Henry’s reign (see <abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 362. <abbr title="Compare">Cf.</abbr> Orderic,
783 D, 833 D; <abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum five">Mon. Angl. v.</abbr> 105, in the account of Saint James’
priory near Exeter). The words in which the Duke bids Richard
leave his service for that of Henry (14534&ndash;14545) are curious,
and throw light on the many expressions in Domesday about the
grant or <em>invasio</em> of a freeman and the like (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest four">N. C. iv.</abbr> 723;
<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 751;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Jo ne sai ke Richart pensa,</div>
<div class="i0">Mais semblant fist ke li pesa</div>
<div class="i0">K’il deveit del duc tot partir</div>
<div class="i0">E son frère Henris servir.</div>
<div class="i0">Richart, dist li dus, si fereiz,</div>
<div class="i0">Henris mon frere servireiz,</div>

<div class="i0">Vos n’arez jà de li hontage,</div>
<div class="i0">Nos somes andui d’un parage.”</div>
</div>

<p>We may compare the story in Orderic, 814 B, C, where Duke
Robert grants Count William of Evreux to his brother (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ei Guellelmum
consulem Ebroarum cum comitatu suo et omnibus sibi
subjectis concessit”</span>), and where the Count is amazed at finding
himself likened to a horse or an ox (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“præclarus comes, ut se quasi
equum vel bovem dandum audivit”</span>). The thoughts of Richard,
which Wace did not know, may have been much the same as those
of Count William.</p>

<p>Robert then goes on his invasion of England, but leaves off on
William’s engaging to pay him five thousand pounds yearly
(14548&ndash;14871). This, I need hardly say, is pure fiction; or rather
it is Robert’s expedition in the reign of Henry carried back to the
reign of Rufus. On coming back to Normandy, Robert quarrels
with Henry, it is not easy to see why, while William is also angry
with him on account of the help in money given by him to Robert.
Robert then takes possession of the Côtentin, and does not repay
Henry his money (14874&ndash;14887);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Robert out l’aveir despendu,</div>
<div class="i0">E Costentin a retenu,</div>
<div class="i0">Ne Henris Costentin n’en out,</div>
<div class="i0">Ne ses deniers aveir ne pout.”</div>
</div>

<p>Henry then defends himself on Saint Michael’s Mount, and the
account of the siege follows. Henry’s voyage to England, and his
imprisonment, which is said to be at Rouen, are placed later still
(14754&ndash;14759).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the short account given by Robert of
Torigny in the Continuation of William of Jumièges (<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 2) is
<a name="Page_515" id="Page_515"></a><span class="pageno">515</span>
much more nearly in agreement with Orderic. He records the
bequest of five thousand pounds to Henry, with the addition that
it was in English money (<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 854). He then mentions
the cession of the Côtentin to Henry, but he is uncertain whether
to call it a grant, or, with Wace, a pledge (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Robertus frater suus
dedit illi comitatum Constantiensem, vel, ut alii volunt, invadiavit”</span>).
He says nothing about Henry’s voyage to England in 1088; but
he mentions the slanders against Henry and his consequent imprisonment
by Robert. Here comes in his only point of difference
from Orderic. Orderic (672 D, see above, <a href="#Page_199"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 199</a>) makes Henry
come back from England in company with Robert of Bellême; they
are both seized on the sea-shore, and are shut up in different
prisons;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quidam malevoli discordiæ satores eos anticipaverunt, et, falsa
veris immiscentes, Roberto duci denuntiaverunt quod … cum rege
Rufo essent pacificati, et ad ducis damnum sacramenti etiam obligatione
confœderati. Dux igitur … cum Baiocensi episcopo consilium
iniit et præfatos optimates præoccupavit. Nam antequam
aliquid molirentur, quum securi ad littus maris de navibus egrederentur,
valida militum manu missa eos comprehendit, vinculis
coarctavit, et unum Baiocis aliumque Noilleio sub manu Baiocensis
tyranni custodiæ mancipavit.”</p>

<p>Robert of Torigny, on the other hand, like Wace, makes Rouen
the place of arrest; but he does not go on to say with William of
Malmesbury that it was the place of imprisonment (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Inventis
quibusdam vilibus occasionibus, per malorum tamen hominum suggestiones,
ipsum nihil tale meditantem apud Rothomagum capiens,
quod dederat indecenter extorsit”</span>). These last words of course refer
to the Côtentin, and imply an occupation of it by Robert during
Henry’s imprisonment. Later events follow in much the same
order as in Orderic.</p>

<p>The author of the Brevis Relatio, who wrote in Henry’s reign,
must have drawn from the same sources as the Continuator, as
the words of his short account (11) are to some extent the same.
He gives a clear and terse summary of the fortunes of Henry
during the reign of Rufus, which is almost his only mention of
that reign. The words which at present concern us are these;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Henricus remansit in Normannia cum Roberto fratre suo, qui
dedit ei quamdam terram in Normannia, sed non diutius inde</span>
<a name="Page_516" id="Page_516"></a><span class="pageno">516</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gaudium habuit [“Non diutius inde gavisus est,”</span> says the Continuator].
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non multo enim tempore, inventis quibusdam vilibus
occasionibus, ei illam abstulit.”</span></p>

<p>The agreement between Orderic and Robert of Torigny is the
more valuable, because they clearly write from independent sources,
and, as we shall see presently, fill up gaps in one another. William
of Malmesbury brings in his story incidentally, and has made confusions.
Wace, as is not at all wonderful, is less accurate at this
part of his narrative than he was at an earlier stage. The expedition
of the Conqueror was his main subject, and on that he
evidently bestowed the greatest care, not only in gathering information
from all quarters, but very often in sifting it. He is now
dealing with the kind of time which most men in all ages know
least about, the times a little before and a little after his own birth.
I must confess, for my own part, that there is no part of English
history in which I feel so little at home as in the administration of
the Earl of Liverpool.</p>

<p class="p2">Anyhow William of Newburgh speaks with great truth when,
after (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 2) sketching the character of William and Robert, he
adds; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Porro Henricus frater junior, laudabilem præferens indolem,
duris et infidis fratribus militabat.”</span></p>

<p class="center sc">The Death of Conan.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> death of Conan suggests the death of Eadric (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume one pages">N. C. vol.
i. pp.</abbr> 415, 740); only, while the story of Eadric’s death has grown
into several mythical forms, we have only two versions of the
death of Conan. These are given us by Orderic (689) and by William
of Malmesbury (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 392). Both of these are contemporary writers in
the sense of having been born at the time&mdash;&#8203;Orderic was about fourteen&mdash;&#8203;though
neither could have written his account till a good
many years after. Orderic’s account is remarkably clear and circumstantial;
and, if the sharp interchang of sentences between Henry
and Conan is open to suspicion of another kind, it is not open to
the same kind of suspicion which attaches to rhetorical speeches
<a name="Page_517" id="Page_517"></a><span class="pageno">517</span>
in Orderic or anywhere else. No one but Henry himself could
have told the story in the first instance, and stories of this kind,
coming under the head of personal anecdote, commonly get improved
as they pass from mouth to mouth. But there is no reason to
suspect any invention on the part of Orderic himself, which in
a long speech we always may suspect. With these prudent allowances,
we may surely accept the tale as it stands in Orderic. The
version of William of Malmesbury reads like a rather careless summary
of some account to the same general effect as Orderic, but
with some differences of detail. But the dramatic effect of Orderic’s
dialogue has wholly passed away from William’s abridgement.</p>

<p>I will mention the chief differences between the two accounts.
According to Orderic, Duke Robert was all this time on the other
side of the Seine; William, who knows nothing about his flight,
keeps him still at Rouen. Here Orderic’s version is clearly to
be preferred. The story of Robert’s flight is either true, or else
direct invention. I do not mean an invention of Orderic, but an
invention of Robert’s enemies at the time. But if William had
never heard that story, he would conceive the Duke to be at
Rouen as a matter of course. William then makes Robert wish
to put Conan in prison; but Henry demands that he should be
given over to himself (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Conanum quendam, proditionis apud
comitem insimulatum, quem ille vinculis irretire volebat, arbitratus
nihil calamitosius posse inferri misero quam ut exosum spiritum in
ergastulo traheret&mdash;&#8203;hunc ergo Conanum Henricus suæ curæ servatum
iri postulavit”</span>). Robert here seems to wish for Conan’s
imprisonment, not out of the merciful feeling which Orderic attributes
to him when he comes back to the city, but rather as
deeming imprisonment worse than death. In either case Henry
goes on the principle that “stone dead hath no fellow.”</p>

<p>In the summary of the dialogue, William brings in one or two
points which are not in Orderic. As Henry shows the view to
Conan, he promises in mockery that all shall be his; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“sua per
ironiam omnia futura pronuntians.”</span> This differs altogether from
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quam pulcram tibi patriam conatus es subjicere.”</span> One is half
tempted to see in William’s version a touch of legend worked in
from the Gospels.</p>

<p>Instead of Henry’s characteristic oath by the soul of his mother,
which must surely be genuine, William puts into his mouth a
<a name="Page_518" id="Page_518"></a><span class="pageno">518</span>
discourse on the duty of the vassal, and his punishment if faithless,
which seems a little too long for the time and place; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nullam
vitæ moram deberi traditori: quoquo modo alieni hominis posse
tolerari injurias, illius vero qui tibi juratus fecerit hominium, nullo
modo posse differri supplicium si fuerit probatus perfidiæ.”</span></p>

<p>From the narrative of Orderic, one would certainly infer that
Henry and Conan were alone together in the tower, Henry doubtless
armed and Conan unarmed. William of Malmesbury gives Henry
companions who help to throw Conan down; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“comitibus qui secum
aderant pariter impellentibus.”</span> The exact spot also seems differently
conceived by the two writers. William of Malmesbury makes
Conan fall into the river; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“inopinum ex propugnaculo deturbans
in subjectam Sequanam præcipitavit.”</span> This seems quite inconsistent
with Orderic, whose words (690 D) are;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Contemptis elegi supplicationibus, ipsum ambabus manibus
impulit, et per fenestram turris deorsum præcipitavit. Qui
miserabili casu in momento confractus est, et <em>antequam solum
attingeret</em> mortuus est. Deinde cadaver illius jumenti caudæ innexum
est, et per omnes Rothomagi vicos ad terrendos desertores
turpiter pertractum est.”</p>

<p>From this it seems clear that Conan fell on dry ground. And
though the river, before the quays were made, certainly came nearer
to the walls of the castle than it now does to their site, one can hardly
fancy that it came so close to the foot of the great tower that Conan
could actually fall into the water. William too conceives those
concerned&mdash;&#8203;whether two or more&mdash;&#8203;as standing on the top of the
tower, whence Conan is thrust down from a battlement (“propugnaculum”)
to which he clings. Orderic seems to conceive him
as pushed out of a window (“fenestra”) in one of the upper rooms
“solaria”) of the tower. It is possible however that by “fenestra”
Orderic may mean the embrasure of a battlement. There is not
so much difference between the two things as might seem at first
sight. When the towers (see Viollet-le-Duc’s Military Architecture,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">passim</i>) were covered with roofs fitting down on the battlements,
the embrasure was in fact a window. In no case must we fancy
Henry and Conan standing together in the open air on the top
of a flat-roofed tower.</p>

<p class=" center sc">The Siege of Courcy.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> siege of Courcy by Duke Robert (<abbr title="Orderic Vitalis">Ord. Vit.</abbr> 692) is remarkable
for some picturesque details, which are interesting in themselves,
and throw light on the times, though they do not directly
concern the history of William Rufus. I was at Courcy in 1875;
but I cannot find any notes on the castle. As far as I remember,
it does not stand on any remarkable height, and does not contain
among its remains any marked features of the eleventh century.
There is however at Courcy a remarkably fine church of the twelfth.</p>

<p>Among the allies who came to the help of the besieged were
several French knights, two of whom bore epithets which show
that, in the days of the chivalrous King, we are getting near to
the times of chivalry. Among the defenders of Courcy were the
White Knight and the Red Knight;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ad conflictus istorum convenerunt Mathæus comes de Bellomonte
et Guillelmus de Garenna, aliique plures, ut in tali gymnasio suas
ostentarent probitates. Ibi Tedbaldus Gualeranni de Britolio filius
et Guido Rubicundus occisi sunt. Quorum prior, quia cornipes et
omnia indumenta ejus candida erant, Candidus Eques appellabatur.
Sequens quoque Rubeus, quia rubeis opertus erat, cognominabatur.”</p>

<p>Of these persons, the younger William of Warren, son of the
elder William and Gundrada, elder brother of the Reginald whom we
have met at Rouen, belongs to our home circle. Count Matthew
of the French Beaumont in the modern department of Oise&mdash;&#8203;to
be distinguished alike from our Norman and our Cenomannian
Beaumont&mdash;&#8203;a kinsman of Hugh of Grantmesnil’s wife (<abbr title="Orderic Vitalis">Ord. Vit.</abbr>
691 D), appears again twice in Orderic, 836 B, 854 B, the second time
at the battle of Noyon. Both times he appears in company with
his neighbour Burchard of Montmorency. Guy the Red Knight
appears in the former passage as an intended father-in-law of the
future King Lewis;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In juventute sua Ludovicus filiam Guidonis Rubei comitis de
Rupeforti desponsavit, et hereditario jure competentem comitatum
subjugare sibi sategit. Capreosam et Montem Leherici, et Bethilcurtem
aliaque oppida obsedit, sed multis nobilibus illi fortiter
<a name="Page_520" id="Page_520"></a><span class="pageno">520</span>
obstantibus non obtinuit, præsertim quia Lucianam virginem quam
desponsaverat Guiscardo de Belloloco donaverat.”</p>

<p>This Rochefort is in the department of Seine and Oise, between
Montfort l’Amaury and Montl’hery. The redness of its Count
and the whiteness of Theobald land us in quite another state of
things from the personal whiteness and redness of Fulk the Red,
Wulfward the White, and others. We seem to be in the fourteenth
century rather than in the eleventh. But we must remember
that at the battle of Noyon, twenty-eight years later, the French
knights at least had armorial bearings (<abbr title="Orderic Vitalis">Ord. Vit.</abbr> 855 B, C; see
<abbr title="Norman Conquest five">N. C. v.</abbr> 189). All these things are French to begin with; they
spread from France into Normandy, and from Normandy into
England.</p>

<p>In this siege we meet with an instance, of which I shall have to
speak again (see <a href="#Note_FF">Note FF</a>), of the wooden tower employed against a
fortified place; not a moving tower, it would seem, but one of those
of which we have so often heard. Yet it is spoken of as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ingens
machina quam <em>berfredum</em> vocitant”</span> (<abbr title="Orderic Vitalis">Ord. Vit.</abbr> 692 C, <abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> 878 C). So
in <abbr title="William of Malmesbury four">Will. Malms. iv.</abbr> 369, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pro lignorum penuria turris non magna, in
modum ædificiorum facta; <em>Berfreid</em> appellant, quod fastigium murorum
æquaret.”</span> This is the <em>beffroi</em>, whose English form of <em>belfry</em> has
got quite another use. It was made at Christmas, seemingly by
order of Robert of Bellême. But one day, when the arch-enemy
was driven back, a daring esquire, a kind of land Kanarês, climbed
into it, and set it on fire (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Justo Dei judicio machina combusta
est, quæ tyrannico jussu in diebus sanctæ nativitatis Domini
proterve fabricata est;”</span> 693 A). We have a story something like
this in the legend of our own Hereward (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 472).
The castle being newly built, they had not been able to build an
oven inside it (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pro acceleratione obsidionis in novo munimento
construere furnum oppidanis fas non fuerat”</span>). They had therefore
to make use of one which stood outside the castle, commanded by
the <em>beffroi</em> (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Clibanus extra munitionem inter machinam oppidique
portam stabat, ibique panificus</span> [surely Eurysakês by the <em>Porta Maggiore</em>
would have liked so sounding a title] <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad subsidium inclusorum
panes coquebat”</span>). The <em>beffroi</em> then was not brought up immediately
against the wall. There was therefore much fighting over the
loaves, and many men were killed at this particular point. In one
day’s fight twenty men were killed and many wounded. These last
<a name="Page_521" id="Page_521"></a><span class="pageno">521</span>
had a scruple; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“de panibus emptis cruore suo non gustaverunt.”</span>
Notwithstanding the <em>beffroi</em> and the fighting, Duke Robert kept
very bad watch; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In conspectu obsidentium commilitones obsessorum
in castellum quotidie intrabant, et armis ac alimentis <em>non
curante duce</em> socios ne deficerent confortabantur.”</span></p>

<p>The bishop of the diocese, Gerard of Seez (1082&ndash;1091), came
and took up his quarters in the neighbourhood, in the abbey of
Saint Peter-on-Dive, and tried to bring about peace (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ut dissidentes
parrochianos suos pacificaret”</span>); but in vain. A boy of noble
birth in the Bishop’s service (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“puer quidam qui præsuli ministrabat;
idem puer Ricardus de Guaspreia, filius Sevoldi, vocitabatur”</span>),
who is afterwards described as “clericus” and “imberbis clericus,”
rides about the camp in boyish fashion (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“dum per exercitum puerili
more ludens equitabat”</span>). The boy’s family are among those who
had to defend themselves against the devil of Bellême (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“cujus parentela
contra Robertum sese jamdudum defendere totis viribus
nitebatur”</span>). So, when young Richard appears in the camp, Robert
pushes him from his horse, puts him in prison, takes the horse to
himself, and threatens his master the Bishop (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Robertus injuriam
ei [Gerardo] maximam fecit, eumque minis contristavit. Nam
puerum … ejectum de equo comprehendit et in carcere trusit,
sibique cornipedem retentavit”</span>). The Bishop threatens the whole
army with interdict, unless his beardless clerk is restored, which is
done after a few days. The Bishop by this time is sick; he goes to
Seez and dies, January 23, 1091, in the same week, according to
Orderic (693 B), in which William Rufus crossed the sea. His successor
was the more famous Serlo, who so vigorously sheared the
locks of the Lion of Justice and his court.</p>

<p>The boy of high birth serving in the bishop’s household, and
counted as belonging to the clerical order&mdash;&#8203;he may even have held
preferment, as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pueri canonici”</span> were not unknown&mdash;&#8203;is worth
notice. The incredible tale told by Giraldus of William Longchamp
(<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 423) at least witnesses to the existence of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pueri
nobiles ad mensam ministrantes”</span> in a bishop’s court.</p>

<p>Lastly, it must not be forgotten that it was during the siege of
Courcy, on the first day of the year 1091 (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in capite Januarii”</span>), that
a priest of the diocese of Lisieux, Walchelm by name, saw that
wonderful vision of souls in purgatorial suffering, including many
of his personal acquaintance and several respectable prelates,
<a name="Page_522" id="Page_522"></a><span class="pageno">522</span>
for Bishop Hugh of Lisieux and Abbot Mainer of Saint Evroul
(see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume three page">N. C. vol. iii. p.</abbr> 383, <abbr title="volume four page">vol. iv. p.</abbr> 655) were there also, which is
told so graphically by Orderic (693 C). A rationalistic mind may be
tempted to see in the supernatural procession another of the endless
forms of the Wild Huntsman; but a Defoe-like feeling of
reality is given to the picture, when he reads that Walchelm thought
that they were the following of Robert of Bellême going to besiege
Courcy. He had gone to visit a sick parishioner at a great
distance; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“unde dum solus rediret, et longe ab hominum habitatione
remotus iret, ingentem strepitum velut maximi exercitus
cœpit audire, et familiam Roberti Belesmensis putavit esse, quæ
festinaret Curceium obsidere.”</span></p>

<p class="center sc">The Treaty of 1091.</p>

<p><span class="sc">On</span> the whole, though with some hesitation, I accept Caen as the
place of the treaty between William Rufus and Robert. Orderic
(693 B) places the meeting of the brothers at Rouen; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Duo
fratres Rothomagum pacifice convenerunt, et in unum congregati,
abolitis prioribus querimoniis, pacificati sunt.”</span> The meeting at
Caen and the mediation of the King of the French come from the
Continuation of William of Jumièges (<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 3). The passage stands
in full thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Facta est tandem inter eos apud Cadomum, ut diximus, adminiculante
Philippo rege Francorum, qui in auxilium ducis contra
Willelmum regem apud oppidum Auci ingenti Anglorum et
Normannorum exercitu tunc morantem venerat, qualiscumque concordia,
et quantum ad ducem Robertum spectat probrosa atque
damnosa.”</p>

<p>The story is here told in a hurried and inverted way, as
the whole tale is from the beginning of the chapter; but there
is nothing strictly to be called inaccurate in the story. It may
be that the mention of Philip now is merely a confusion with his
former appearance at Eu; but an intervention of Philip is not unlikely
in itself; Caen too as the place of meeting is less obvious
than Rouen, and so far the statement in favour of it is to be preferred.
<a name="Page_523" id="Page_523"></a><span class="pageno">523</span>
But the point is not of much importance, and the evidence
is fairly open to doubt.</p>

<p>In any case William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 307, 308) is mistaken in
speaking of the peace as agreed and sworn to before William crossed
into Normandy. He gives a picture of the anarchy of Normandy
which is true enough; only he seems to conceive it too much after
the pattern of the later anarchy of England. King Philip (see the
passage quoted in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 239) has got his money and has gone back to
his banquet;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ita bello intestino diu laboravit Normannia, modo illis, modo
istis, vincentibus; proceres utriusque furorem incitabant, homines
levissimi, in neutra parte fidem habentes.”</p>

<p>Now in the days of Stephen the anarchy at least took the form
of a war between rival claimants of the crown. Men really fought
for their own hands; but they at least professed to fight for King
or Empress. But the special characteristic of the Norman anarchy
is that everybody is already fighting with everybody else, and that
the invasion of the country makes no difference, except so far as it
adds a new element of confusion. Ralph of Conches goes over to
William only because Robert fails to defend him against a local
enemy; William’s name is not mentioned at all in the war of
Courcy, till his actual coming frightens both sides alike. William
of Malmesbury misses the special point of the whole story, namely
that the strife between William and Robert stands quite distinct
from the local struggles which still went on all over the country,
except when the two got intermingled at particular points. He
then adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Pauci quibus sanius consilium, consulentes suis commodis quod
utrobique possessiones haberent, mediatores pacis fuere; ut comiti
rex Cinomannis adquireret, comes regi castella quæ habebat et
Fiscannum cœnobium concederet. Juratum est hoc pactum, et ab
utrorumque hominibus sacramento firmatum. Nec multo post rex
mare transiit, ut fidem promissorum expleret.”</p>

<p>Florence (1091) puts the case much better;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Mense Februario rex Willelmus junior Normanniam petiit, ut
eam fratri suo Rotberto abriperet; sed dum ibi moraretur, pax inter
eos facta est.”</p>

<p class="p2">It will be seen that William of Malmesbury gives only a very
<a name="Page_524" id="Page_524"></a><span class="pageno">524</span>
imperfect statement of the terms of the treaty. They are nowhere
so fully and clearly given as in our own Chronicle; only the
English writer is not quite so exact with regard to the territorial
cessions as those writers who wrote in Normandy. The brothers
meet&mdash;&#8203;the place is not mentioned&mdash;&#8203;and agree on the terms, which
are given in words which sound like the actual words of the treaty,
which was likely enough to be set down in an English as well as
a Latin copy. They stand thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“þæt se eorl him to handan let Uescam and þone eorldom æt
Ou, and Kiæresburh. And þærto eacan þes cynges men sæclæs
beon moston on þam castelan þe hi ær þes eorles unþances begiten
hæfdon. And se cyng him ongean þa Manige behet þa ær heora
fæder gewann, and þa fram þam eorle gebogen wæs gebygle to
donne, and eall þæt his fæder þær begeondan hæfde, butan þam
þe he þam cynge þa geunnen hæfde; and þæt ealle þa þe on Englelande
for þam eorle æror heora land forluron hit on þisum sehte
habban sceoldan and se eorl on Englelande eallswa mycel swa on
heora forewarde wæs.”</p>

<p>The emphatic references to his father are preeminently characteristic
of the Red King. We seem to hear his very words, the words
of the dutiful son, granting, not without some sarcasm, to the rebel,
the heritage of the father against whom he had rebelled. This
emphatic feature disappears in the other versions, even in the
abridged Latin version of Florence. To the list of places in
Normandy to be given up he adds <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“abbatiam in monte sancti
Michaelis sitam,”</span> and the last words, which are certainly not very
clear, he translates <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“et tantum terræ quantum conventionis inter
eos fuerat comiti daret.”</span> This can only refer to something which
William was to grant to Robert as a free gift. Domesday shows
that there were no older English possessions of Robert to be given
back to him. See <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 629.</p>

<p>Besides William of Malmesbury, only the Chronicler and Florence
mention the stipulation about Maine. This is again a
sign that in the Chronicle we are dealing with an actual
document. For, as nothing came of that clause, no part of the
treaty was more likely to be forgotten. William of Malmesbury
seems to have caught up the first words of the treaty, and to
have got no further. Thus Maine gets in his text an undue
prominence, which may possibly account for a statement of his
<a name="Page_525" id="Page_525"></a><span class="pageno">525</span>
which follows, and which has nothing at all like it anywhere else.
The King and the Duke are going to attack Maine the very first
thing after the conclusion of the treaty; only they are hindered
by the campaign against Henry; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ergo uterque dux ingentes
moliebantur conatus ut Cinomannis invaderent; sed obstitit jam
paratis jamque profecturis Henrici fratris minoris animositas.”</span></p>

<p>It may be needful to point out that the Chronicle really does
mention Maine; for Mr. Earle seems to have been the first of
its editors to find out the fact. Gibson, Ingram, and Thorpe all
print “þa manige,” with a small <i>m</i>, and explain it “the many,”
“the many castles,” “multa castella.” But, if there were no other
reason, the words which answer to it in Florence, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cenomannicam
vero provinciam,”</span> are enough to show that we should read with
Mr. Earle “þa Manige,” the county of Maine. The French idiom,
whatever may be its origin, which, as is always the case in Wace,
adds the article to <em>Le</em> Mans, <em>Le</em> Maine, is here found in English.
So it is in 1099, 1110, 1111, 1112. The earlier entry in 1073,
“þæt land Mans,” is less clear.</p>

<p>Those who wrote in Normandy say nothing about Maine; but
they more distinctly define the cessions in Normandy itself. Thus
Robert of Torigny in his Continuation (Will. Gem. <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 3);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quidquid rex Willelmus in Normannia occupaverat, <em>per infidelitatem
hominum ducis, qui eidem regi suas munitiones tradiderant,
quas suis militibus ipse commiserat ut inde fratrem suum
infestarent</em>, impune permissus est habere. Munitiones illæ quas
hoc modo tenebat fuerunt, Fiscannum, oppidum Auci <em>quod Willelmus
comes Aucensis cum reliquis suis firmitatibus illi tradiderat;
similiter Stephanus comes de Albamarla, filius Odonis comitis de
Campania, Willielmi autem regis Anglorum senioris ex sorore nepos,
fecerat, et alii plures ultra Sequanam habitantes</em>.”</p>

<p>The words in Italics are the writer’s backward way of recording
the events of 1090 among the clauses of the treaty of 1091.
In his own chronicle (1091) Robert of Torigny has nothing to say,
except <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ut castra illa quæ frater ab eo acquisierat regi remanerent.”</span>
This not very clear account comes from Henry of Huntingdon (<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr>
2, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 215 <abbr title="edited">ed.</abbr> Arnold), with the omission of an important word.
But though Robert mentions no particular places in his summary
of the treaty, yet, in copying Henry of Huntingdon’s account of
the places occupied by William’s troops in 1090, to Saint Valery
<a name="Page_526" id="Page_526"></a><span class="pageno">526</span>
which alone are mentioned by Henry, he adds, not only Eu like our
authorities, but also Fécamp. The Chronicle, as we have seen,
mentions Fécamp among the places which were to be ceded to
William in 1091; no one else mentions it among the places which
were occupied in 1090.</p>

<p>Orderic has three references to the cessions; but he nowhere
mentions either Fécamp or Saint Michael’s Mount. In his first
account (693 B, C) he says only <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Robertus dux … ei [regi] Aucensem
comitatum et Albamarlam, totamque terram Gerardi de
Gornaco et Radulfi de Conchis, cum omnibus municipiis eorum
eisque subjectorum concessit.”</span> In 697 C he says only <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Robertus
dux magnam partem Normanniæ Guillelmo regi concessit.”</span></p>

<p class="p2">It is the Chronicle again which seems to give us the real text
of the clauses about the succession;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“And gif se eorl forðferde butan sunu be rihtre ǽwe, wære se
cyng yrfenuma of ealles Normandig. Be þisre sylfan forewarde,
gif se cyng swulte, wære se eorl yrfenuma ealles Englalandes.”</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth notice that these words taken strictly do
not contemplate the possibility of William Rufus leaving children.
This is slightly altered in Florence;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Si comes absque filio legali in matrimonio genito moreretur,
hæres ejus esset rex; <em>modoque per omnia simili</em>, si regi contigisset
mori, hæres illius fieret comes.”</p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon (<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 215 <abbr title="edited">ed.</abbr> Arnold), who, as we have
seen, is followed with some changes by Robert of Torigny, seems to
abridge the account in the Chronicle. After speaking of the events
of 1090, he adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Anno vero sequenti rex sequens eos concordiam cum fratre suo
fecit. Eo tamen pacto ut castra illa quæ frater ab illo injuria acquisierat,
regi remanerent, rex autem adjuvaret eum ad omnia quæ
pater suus habuerat conquirenda. Statutum etiam, si quis eorum
moreretur prior altero sine filio, quod alter fieret hæres illius.”</p>

<p>A good deal of the diplomatic exactness of the Chronicle is lost
here, and it is not easy to see what castles Robert had taken from
William, unjustly or otherwise. Robert of Torigny hardly mends
the matter by leaving out the word “injuria.”</p>

<p>Henry is not mentioned in any account of the treaty; but his
possessions come by implication under the head of the lands which
<a name="Page_527" id="Page_527"></a><span class="pageno">527</span>
William was to win back for Robert, with the exception of Cherbourg
and Saint Michael’s Mount&mdash;&#8203;if we are right in adding the
Mount on the authority of Florence&mdash;&#8203;which William was to keep
for himself. The shameful treatment of Henry by his brothers
naturally calls forth a good deal of sympathy on the part of some
of our writers, though they do not always bring out the state of
the case very clearly. They speak of his brothers refusing him a
share in his father’s dominions, rather than of their depriving
him of the possessions which one of themselves had sold to him.
Hear for instance the author of the Brevis Relatio (11), writing in
Henry’s own reign;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Concordiam adinvicem fecerunt Willelmus secundus rex Angliæ
et Robertus comes Normanniæ, et quum fratrem suum Henricum
debuissent adjuvare, eique providere ut honorabiliter inter
illos sicut frater eorum et filius regis vivere posset, non hoc fecerunt,
sed de tota terra patris sui expellere conati sunt.”</p>

<p>The same words are used by Robert of Torigny, in the Continuation
of William of Jumièges, <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 3.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 308), in a passage which follows that
which has been already cited about Maine, after the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Henrici
fratris minoris animositas,”</span> adds, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“qui frenderet propter fratrum
avaritiam, quod uterque possessiones paternas dividerent, et se
omnium pene expertem non erubescerent.”</span></p>

<p>The treaty takes a very strange form in Matthew Paris, <abbr title="Historia Anglorum one">Hist. Angl. i.</abbr> 39.
The brothers are reconciled by wise friends, who say
to them, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Absit, ne Franci fraternas acies, alternaque regna profanis
decertata odiis, derideant subsannantes.”</span> And the reason is
given; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Franci enim eo tempore multa super ducem occupaverant.”</span>
This hardly means the Vexin; it is more likely to be a confused
version of Philip’s intervention.</p>

<p class="p2">The only writers who mention the driving out of Eadgar are the
Chronicler and Florence. The former brings it into connexion
with the treaty, without seeming to make it exactly part of the
treaty itself. Having given the clauses of the treaty, and mentioned
its confirmation by the oaths on both sides, he adds; “Onmang þisum
sæhte wearð Eadgar æþeling belandod of þam þe se eorl him æror
þær to handa gelæten hæfde.” The measure seems to have had
something to do with the treaty without being one of its clauses.
<a name="Page_528" id="Page_528"></a><span class="pageno">528</span>
Were such things as secret or additional articles, or agreements
which were to go for nothing because they were not written on
the same paper as other agreements, known to so early a stage
of diplomacy?</p>

<p>The Chronicler does not mention the siege of Saint Michael’s
Mount; but, immediately after the confiscation of Eadgar’s lands
in Normandy, he mentions his voyage to Scotland and the events
which followed on it. Florence puts his account of the siege of the
Mount directly after the treaty and the oaths of the twenty-four
barons. He then goes on;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“At rex cum obsidionis diutinæ pertæsus fuisset, impacatus recessit,
et non multo post Eadgarum clitonem honore, quem ei comes
dederat, privavit et de Normannia expulit.”</span> And a little way on
he speaks of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“clito Eadgarus, quem rex de Normannia expulerat.”</span>
These expressions make the treatment of Eadgar more distinctly
William’s own act than one would infer from the words of the
Chronicle, and they might suggest that Eadgar’s Norman estates
lay within the districts which were ceded to William. But it may
only mean that Robert sent Eadgar away on William’s demand.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Siege of Saint Michael’s Mount.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> primary account of the siege which Henry endured at the
hands of his brothers is the short one in Orderic, which I have
chiefly followed in the text. There are still shorter notices in
Florence of Worcester and in the Continuation of William of
Jumièges. The shortest of all is in the local Annals;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“1090. Obsessio montis hujus, quæ facta est a Guillelmo Rufo
rege Anglorum et a Roberto comite Normannorum, Henrico fratre
eorum in hoc monte incluso.”</p>

<p>There is no objection to this date, as the writer seemingly begins
the year at Easter. The accession of Harold is placed under 1065.</p>

<p>The account in Florence is noteworthy, as seeming to supply a
reason for the attack made by the two older brothers upon the
younger. After the treaty between William and Robert, he goes on;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Interim germanus illorum Heinricus montem Sancti Michaelis,
ipsius loci monachis quibusdam illum adjuvantibus, cum omnibus
<a name="Page_529" id="Page_529"></a><span class="pageno">529</span>
militibus quos habere potuit, intravit, regisque erram vastavit, et
ejus homines quosdam captivavit, quosdam exspoliavit. Eapropter
rex et comes, exercitu congregato, per totam quadragesimam montem
obsederunt, et frequenter cum eo prœlium commiserunt, et homines
et equos nonnullos perdiderunt. At rex, cum obsidionis diutinæ
pertæsus fuisset, impacatus recessit.”</p>

<p>This account is true in a sense; it gives the purely military
history, except that the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“impacatus recessit”</span> would hardly
suggest Henry’s honourable surrender. But no one would find out
from Florence’s version that Henry occupied the Mount simply as
the last spot left to him in his dominions. As a matter of warfare,
it doubtless may be said that William and Robert besieged Henry
because he occupied the Mount, and because he was, as we can well
believe, driven to harry the neighbouring lands. But he occupied
the Mount and harried the lands only because he was driven out of
the rest of his county. That Florence misunderstood the matter is
plain from his use of the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“regis terra,”</span> which cannot apply
to any land which could be reached from the Mount.</p>

<p>Wace has a long account, very confused in its chronology and in
the sequence of events; but I have trusted to his local knowledge
for some topographical details. William of Malmesbury twice refers
to the siege. He tells it under the reign of Rufus (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 308); but
seemingly wholly for the purpose of bringing in two famous anecdotes
about William and Robert. The second time is in his sketch
of Henry’s early life (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 392). In the first account he at least puts
the siege in its right place after the Treaty of 1091. In the second
he seems, strangely enough, to make the siege immediately follow
the death of Conan, or at least to follow Henry’s driving out of Rouen
(see above, <a href="#Page_512"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 512</a>), which he places just after Conan’s death;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Illud fuit tempus quo, ut supra lectum est, apud montem sancti
Michaelis ambobus fratribus Henricus pro sui salute simul et gloria
restitit.”</p>

<p>And, as Orderic (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 294) is careful to insist on the wholesome
effect which the season of exile which followed had on Henry’s
character, so William insists on the wholesome effect of the siege
itself;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ita, cum utrique germano fuerit fidelis et efficax, illi nullis
adolescentem possessionibus dignati, ad majorem prudentiam ævi
processu penuria victualium informabant.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530"></a><span class="pageno">530</span>
The Red King’s way of schooling a brother was not quite so
harsh as that by which Gideon taught the men of Succoth; but
it is essentially of the same kind.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more confused than the way in which Wace
brings in the story (see Pluquet’s note, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 310). I have already
(see above, <a href="#Page_514"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 514</a>) mentioned the course of his story up to that
point. Robert, without any help from William, has deprived
Henry of the Côtentin, while William is angry with Henry for
having paid the purchase-money to Robert. Henry then goes to
the Mount (14588);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Por sei vengier se mist el munt</div>
<div class="i0">U li muignes Saint Michiel sunt.”</div>
</div>

<p>Then, having no place of shelter anywhere, he gathers a large company
of nobles and others who serve him willingly (14598);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“N’alout mie eschariement,</div>
<div class="i0">Asez menout od li grant gent</div>
<div class="i0">Des plus nobles è des gentilz,</div>
<div class="i0">Mena od li freres è filz;</div>
<div class="i0">E tuit volentiers le servient,</div>
<div class="i0">Kar grant espeir en li aveient.”</div>
</div>

<p>He thinks of seeking a lasting shelter in Britanny; but he is
entertained by Earl Hugh at Avranches, with whom he has much
talk, and who one day counsels him to occupy the Mount and to
make a castle of the monastery. This is without any reference
to the lines just quoted in which Henry is made to have been
there already. But the speech of the Earl is well conceived
(14624);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Li munt Saint Michiel li mostra:</div>
<div class="i0">Veiz tu, dist-il, cele roche là;</div>
<div class="i0">Bel lieu è forte roche i a,</div>
<div class="i0">Ke jor ke noit ja ne faldra;</div>
<div class="i0">Flo de mer montant l’avirone,</div>
<div class="i0">Ki à cel lieu grant force done.”</div>
</div>

<p>Henry will do well to get together Bretons and mercenaries, and
hold the rock against the Normans (14625);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Bretuns mandasse è soldéiers,</div>
<div class="i0">Ki gaaignassent volentiers,</div>
<div class="i0">Mult méisse gent en grant esfrei;</div>
<div class="i0">Jà Normant n’éust paiz vers mei.”</div>
</div>

<p>Henry adopts Hugh’s advice, rides off at once, occupies the Mount,
and sends a defiance to Robert (14646);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Maiz Henris est sempres monté,</div>
<div class="i0">Et el munt est sempres alé.</div>
<div class="i0">Del munt Saint Michiel guerréia,</div>
<div class="i0">Robert son frere desfia.</div>
<div class="i0">Ja mez, ço dist, sa paiz n’areit,</div>
<div class="i0">Se son aveir ne li rendeit.”</div>
</div>
<a name="Page_531" id="Page_531"></a><span class="pageno">531</span>

<p>Henry ravages the neighbouring lands (see above, <a href="#Page_529"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 529</a>, and <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 286);
then the King and the Duke come to besiege him, without any hint
how William came to be in Normandy, or how the two brothers,
who were enemies less than a hundred lines before, have now come
to be allies.</p>

<p>It is plain that the striking event of the occupation of the Mount
of which he would hear a good deal in his childhood, if it did not
actually come within his own childish days, was strong in Wace’s
imagination, but that he took very little pains to fit the tale into
its right place in the history. It is specially hard to reconcile his
picture of the action of Earl Hugh with the facts of the case. There
is perhaps no literal contradiction. Hugh, while giving up his
castles to Robert (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 284), may have given Henry secret advice,
and the words of Robert of Torigny in the Continuation of William
of Jumièges (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 323) may be taken as implying that Henry
looked on him as having been on the whole faithful to him. But
Wace could hardly have conceived Hugh as giving up the castle of
Avranches to Robert.</p>

<p>The ending of the siege is still more thoroughly misconceived
than the beginning. The brothers are all reconciled; Henry gets
the Côtentin back again (14740);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“De l’acordement fu la fin</div>
<div class="i0">K’à Henri remest Costentin,</div>
<div class="i0">K’en paiz l’éust tant è tenist,</div>
<div class="i0">Ke li Dus li suen li rendist.”</div>
</div>

<p>William goes back to England, whereas we know (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 293) that
he stayed in Normandy for six months. Robert goes to Rouen.
Henry pays off his mercenaries&mdash;&#8203;out of what funds we are not
told, and the other accounts do not speak of his followers as
mercenaries. He then follows Robert to Rouen (14750);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Henris sis soldeiers paia,</div>
<div class="i0">As uns pramist, as uns dona</div>
<div class="i0">Al terme k’il out establi;</div>
<div class="i0">A li Duc a Roem sui.”</div>
</div>

<p>There the Duke imprisons Henry; that is, the imprisonment which
happened long before (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 199) is moved out of its place. But
Wace cannot tell why he was imprisoned, or how it was that he
was released and made his way to France (14754);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Ne voil avant conter ne dire</div>

<div class="i0">Ki en France l’out poiz od sei.”</div>
</div>

<p>In opposition to all this, Orderic’s account of the siege, its beginning
and its ending, is perfectly straightforward, and hangs
well together. He alone puts everything in its place, and gives
an intelligible reason for everything. Robert of Torigny, in the
Continuation (<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 3), preserves the fact that Henry surrendered
on honourable terms, but he is in rather too great a hurry to get
him to Domfront;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Unde accidit ut quadam vice ipsum obsidione cingerent in
monte sancti Michaelis. Sed illis ibidem incassum diu laborantibus,
et <em>ad ultimum inter se dissidentibus</em>, comes Henricus inde
libere exiens oppidum munitissimum nomine Danfrontem sagacitate
cujusdam indigenæ suscepit.”</p>

<p>The words in Italics may perhaps refer to the story about the
water; but William and Robert were in any case sure to quarrel
about something. And it was quite in William’s character to get
tired of a fifteen days’ siege, as he is represented both here and by
Florence (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 292); only Florence is not justified in saying that
at once <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“impacatus rediit.”</span> William of Malmesbury too (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 310)
tells his story about the water, and then adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ita rex, deridens mansueti hominis ingenium, resolvit prælium;
infectaque re quam intenderat, quod eum Scottorum et Walensium
tumultus vocabant, in regnum se cum ambobus fratribus recepit.”</p>

<p>On these last words, which are so startling at first sight, I have
spoken in the next Note.</p>

<p class="p2">The two anecdotes of William and Robert seem, in William
of Malmesbury’s first account (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 308), to be his chief or only reason
for mentioning the siege at all;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In ea obsidione præcluum specimen morum in rege et comite
apparuit; in altero mansuetudinis, in altero magnanimitatis.
Utriusque exempli notas pro legentium notitia affigam.”</p>

<p>Then come the two stories <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De Magnanimitate Willelmi”</span> and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De Mansuetudine comitis Roberti,”</span> which I have told in the text
after him. Both of them are also told by Wace; that is, if the
story <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De Magnanimitate Willelmi”</span> is really the same story as
the corresponding story in Wace. Every detail is different; but
both alike set before us the self-confidence of the Red King. In
this version he is unhorsed and wounded; but he keeps hold of
his saddle, and fights on foot with his sword (14672);</p>

<div class="poem"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533"></a><span class="pageno">533</span>
<div class="i0a">“E li reis i fa abatuz,</div>
<div class="i0">De plusors lances fu féruz.</div>
<div class="i0">Li peitral del cheval rompi</div>
<div class="i0">E li dui cengles altresi;</div>
<div class="i0">Od sa sele li reis chaï,</div>
<div class="i0">Maiz bien la tint, ne la perdi,</div>
<div class="i0">Delivre fu, en piez sailli;</div>
<div class="i0">Od s’espée se desfendi,</div>
<div class="i0">Unkes la sele ne leissa,</div>
<div class="i0">Bien la tint è bien la garda.”</div>
</div>

<p>We hear nothing of any discourse with Henry’s followers, nothing
of any dealings with the knight who had unhorsed him. But he
calls to his vassals, Normans and English, who do not appear in the
other story, but who in this press to his help, and, after many blows,
take him off safely;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Tant cria chevaliers léals,</div>
<div class="i0">Ke la presse vint des vassals,</div>
<div class="i0">E li Normanz le secorurent</div>
<div class="i0">E li Engleiz ki od li furent,</div>
<div class="i0">Maiz maint grant colp unt recéu</div>
<div class="i0">Ainz k’il l’éussent secoru.</div>
<div class="i0">Mené l’en unt à salveté.”</div>
</div>

<p>Then his own men, not those of Henry, talk merrily with him
about his defence of his saddle. He answers in the like strain,
telling them that it is a shame if a man cannot keep his own,
and that it would have grieved him if any Breton had boasted that
he had carried off his saddle;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Poiz unt li reis asez gabé</div>
<div class="i0">De la sele k’il desfendeit,</div>
<div class="i0">E des granz colps ke il soffreit.</div>
<div class="i0">E li reis diseit en riant</div>
<div class="i0">K’il debveit estre al suen garant;</div>
<div class="i0">Hunte est del suen perdre è guerpir;</div>
<div class="i0">Tant com l’en le pot garantir:</div>
<div class="i0">Pesast li ke Brez s’en vantast</div>
<div class="i0">De la sele k’il emportast.”</div>
</div>

<p>If this is the same story as that in William of Malmesbury, it is a
very inferior version of it. Lappenberg (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte von England</span>,
<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 172) takes the two for distinct stories and tells them separately.
(See above, <a href="#Page_503"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 503.</a>) But it is strange that his translator (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 232)
should tell both stories after his original, should give the reference
to Wace, and should then, at the end of William’s story, remark,
giving the same reference again&mdash;“Wace gives a version of the
occurrence totally different from the above as related by Malmesbury.”</p>

<p>The “Normanz” and “Engleiz” of Wace appear in Lappenberg
as <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Normannen und Angelsachsen.”</span> This involves the old question
about the force of the word “Angli,” which is very hard to answer
at this particular stage. In a narrative actually written in 1091,
I should certainly understand the words as Lappenberg does, and
should see in the “Engleiz” men of the type of Tokig son of
<a name="Page_534" id="Page_534"></a><span class="pageno">534</span>
Wiggod and Robert son of Godwine. But, as Wace, if he were
already born in 1091, did not write till many years after, it is
more likely that we ought to take the words “Normanz” and
“Engleiz” in the sense which they took in the course of Henry
the First’s reign. That is, by “Normanz” we should understand
those only who were “natione Normanni,” and by “Engleiz” all
who were “natione Angligenæ,” even though many of them were
“genere Normanni.” See <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 828.</p>

<p>Whatever we make of the relations between the two stories,
the reference to the “Brez” in Wace’s version has a very genuine
ring. That name came much more home in Jersey, or even at
Bayeux, than it did in Wiltshire.</p>

<p>The story <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De Mansuetudine comitis Roberti”</span> connects itself
with the fact stated by Orderic&mdash;&#8203;who does not tell either of the
anecdotes&mdash;&#8203;that the besieged really did suffer for want of water
(see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 292). William of Malmesbury, whom I have followed in
the text, tells the story straightforwardly enough from that point
of view. Wace does casually speak of the water, but his main
thought is of wine (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 291). Henry thus states his case to
Robert (14704);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Quant Henris out lunges soffert,</div>
<div class="i0">Soef manda al Duc Robert,</div>
<div class="i0">Ke de vin aveit desirier,</div>
<div class="i0">D’altre chose n’aveit mestier.”</div>
</div>

<p>Robert then sends him the tun of wine, of the best they have in
the host, and throws in a truce to take water daily seemingly of
his own free will (14712);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“E tot li jor a otréié</div>
<div class="i0">E par trièves doné congié,</div>
<div class="i0">Ke cil del munt ewe préissent,</div>
<div class="i0">E li munt d’ewe garnessissent,</div>
<div class="i0">U k’il volsissent la préissent</div>
<div class="i0">Séurement, rien ne cremissent.</div>
<div class="i0">Dunc veissez servanz errer,</div>
<div class="i0">Et à veissels ewe aporter.”</div>
</div>

<p>The King is angry at all this, and sets forth his principles of
warfare (14729);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Il les déust fere afamer</div>
<div class="i0">E il les faisoit abevrer.”</div>
</div>

<p>He is inclined to give up the siege (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Del siege volt par mal
torner”</span>); but he listens to Robert’s excuse;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Torné me fust à félonie,</div>
<div class="i0">E joféisse vilanie</div>
<div class="i0">De li néer beivre è viande,</div>
<div class="i0">Quant il méisme le demande.”</div>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535"></a><span class="pageno">535</span>
Here we have nothing of the argument in William of Malmesbury,
an argument essentially the same as that which is so thoroughly
in place in the mouth of the wife of Intaphernes in Herodotus
(<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 119), and so thoroughly out of place in the mouth of the
Antigonê of Sophoklês (892). But the words are very like those
which we shall find Wace putting into the mouth of Robert at a
later time. (See 15456, and <a href="#Page_406"><abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 406</a>.)</p>

<p class="center sc">The Adventures of Henry after the Surrender
of Saint Michael’s Mount.</p>

<p>That Henry was in possession of Domfront in 1094 is certain
from the witness of the Chronicle under that year; “Se cyng W.
sende æfter his broðer Heanrige, se wæs on þam castele æt Damfront.”
But we have no hint when he got possession of it.
Florence has no mention of Henry between his account of the siege
of Saint Michael’s Mount&mdash;&#8203;from which William <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“impacatus recessit”</span>&mdash;&#8203;and
his election as king. William of Malmesbury (see
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 293) brings him to England with William and Robert in
August 1091. As I have already said, such is William of Malmesbury’s
carelessness of chronology that I should not have ventured
to accept this statement on his showing only. But it has a piece
of the very strongest corroborative evidence in the form of the
Durham charter of which I have spoken in the text (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 305).
This is the one which is printed at <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> xxii of the volume of the
Surtees Society called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Historiæ Dunelmensis Scriptores Tres,”</span> a
document which has every sign of genuineness. It is a grant by
Bishop William of the churches of Northallerton, Sigston, and
Brunton to the convent of Durham, and confirms the picture given
by Simeon (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 508) of William Rufus as a benefactor to
Durham;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hæc omnia, præcipiente domino meo Willielmo rege, domini
mei magni regis Willielmi filio, feci, qui Alvertonescire sancto
Cuthberto et episcopis ejus in perpetuum dedit. Has vero ecclesias
monachis sancto Cuthberto servituris pro salute animæ suæ
dedit, et mihi donare præcepit.”</p>

<p>I have shown that the deed must belong to a time after the pacification
<a name="Page_536" id="Page_536"></a><span class="pageno">536</span>
with Malcolm, but before Christmas, 1091. At no other
time could we have had the signatures of Robert and Eadgar, nor
probably that of Duncan. And the signature of Henry shows that
William of Malmesbury is right, and that Henry was in England
at this time. There was then some assembly held in the autumn
of 1091, and that seemingly at Durham or somewhere in the
North. Its object would probably be to confirm the treaty with
Malcolm. Indeed, except a few bishops and abbots, most of the
men who sign would naturally be in the camp. The signatures
are in two columns. That to the right contains the names of Bishop
William, King William (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">signum Willielmi regis secundi</span>), his brothers
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">signum Rodberti fratris regis, signum Henrici fratris regis</span>), Robert
Bloet (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Roberti cancellarii regis cognomento Bloet</span>), Duncan (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dunechani
filii regis Malcolmi</span>), Earl Roger, Randolf Flambard (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ranulphi
thessarii&mdash;&#8203;thesaurarii?</span>), three local priests, Merewine
(Mervini), Eglaf (Ælavi; in another document, <abbr title="page twenty">p. xx</abbr>, we get the
dwelling-places of these priests, Eglaf of Bethlington and Merewine
of Chester&mdash;&#8203;that is of course Chester-le-Street), and Orm,
Robert <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“dispensator regis”</span> (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 331), Siward Barn, and Arnold
of Percy. The left-hand column contains Archbishop Thomas, the
Bishops Remigius of Lincoln, Osmund of Salisbury, and John of
Bath, the Abbots Guy of Saint Augustine’s, Baldwin of Saint
Eadmund’s, and Stephen of Saint Mary’s at York, Earl Hugh,
Philip son of Earl Roger, Earl Robert, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“signum Eadgari clitonis,”</span>
Roger Bigod, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“signum Morealis vicecomitis,”</span> William Peverel,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“signum Gileberti dapiferi.”</span></p>

<p>This list, though singular and startling, is perfectly possible.
This cannot be said of some of those in the same volume. Thus
in the document just before this one, John Bishop of Bath is
made to sign in the time of the Conqueror, and in that which
follows (<abbr title="page 27">p. xxvii</abbr>), Lanfranc and Abbot Ælfsige are made to sign
in 1093.</p>

<p>The evidence of this charter, combined with the notice in
William of Malmesbury, seems conclusive. Henry was in England
during part of 1091. We therefore cannot accept the obvious
meaning of Orderic’s story which makes Henry a wanderer from
the time of the surrender of the Mount till his reception at
Domfront. In this version he leaves the Mount, and spends two
years, or somewhat less, in a very poor case (697 B);
<a name="Page_537" id="Page_537"></a><span class="pageno">537</span></p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Per Britanniam transiit, Britonibus, qui sibi solummodo adminiculum
contulerant, gratias reddidit, et confines postmodum
Francos expetiit. In pago Vilcassino nobilis exsul non plenis
duobus annis commoratus, diversa hospitia quæsivit. Uno tantum
milite unoque clerico cum tribus armigeris contentus pauperem
vitam exegit.”</p>

<p>In another place (698 C) we find a date given to the occupation of
Domfront, and a duration assigned to Henry’s wanderings, which at
first sight seems not to agree with this version;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Anno ab incarnatione Domini <abbr title="1092"><span class="muchsmaller">MXCII.</span></abbr> Indictione <abbr title="15"><span class="muchsmaller">XV.</span></abbr> Henricus
Guillelmi regis filius Danfrontem oppidum, auxilio Dei suffragioque
amicorum, obtinuit, et inde fortiter hereditarium jus calumniari
sategit. Nam idem, dum esset junior, non ut frater a fratribus
habitus est, sed magis ut externus, exterorum, id est Francorum et
Britonum, auxilia quærere coactus est, et quinque annis diversorum
eventuum motibus admodum fatigatus est. Tandem Danfrontani
nutu Dei ærumnis tam præclari exsulis compassi sunt, et ipsum ad
se de Gallia accersitum per Harecherium honorifice susceperunt, et,
excusso Roberti de Belesmo, a quo diu graviter oppressi fuerant,
dominio, Henricum sibi principem constituerunt. Ille vero contra
Robertum Normanniæ comitem viriliter arma sumpsit, incendiis
et rapinis expulsionis suæ injuriam vindicavit, multosque cepit et
carceri mancipavit.”</p>

<p>The five years mentioned in the above extract must be meant to
take in all Henry’s adventures, lucky and unlucky, from the death
of his father in 1087 to his settlement at Domfront in 1092.
From his surrender of the Mount in February 1091 to his settlement
at Domfront Orderic makes, as we have seen, somewhat less
than two years; that is, Henry came to Domfront quite at the end
of 1092.</p>

<p>In 706 C (under 1094, see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 319) he says;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Henricus Guillelmi Magni regis Anglorum filius Danfrontem
possidebat, et super Robertum [de Belesmo], cui præfatum castellum
abstulerat, imo super fratres suos regem et ducem guerram faciebat,
a quibus extorris de cespite paterno expulsus fuerat.”</p>

<p>In 722 D he says;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Henricus frater ducis Danfrontem fortissimum castrum possidebat,
et magnam partem Neustriæ sibi favore vel armis subegerat,
fratrique suo ad libitum suum, nec aliter, obsecundabat.”
<a name="Page_538" id="Page_538"></a><span class="pageno">538</span></p>

<p>This is in 1095, and it is meant as a summary of Henry’s course
up to that year. Lastly, the promise of Henry never to give up
Domfront to any other master comes quite incidentally in Orderic’s
account (788 B) of the treaty between Robert and Henry in 1101
(see <a href="#Page_413"><abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 413</a>). By that treaty Henry ceded to Robert everything
that he held in Normandy <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“præter Danfrontem.”</span> The reason
for the exception is added;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Solum Danfrontem castrum sibi retinuit, quia Danfrontanis,
quando illum intromiserunt, jurejurando pepigerat quod numquam
eos de manu sua projiceret nec leges eorum vel consuetudines
mutaret.”</p>

<p>This is Orderic’s account, in which I see no difficulty at all in
accepting all that concerns Domfront. Henry was in England late
in 1091; but he may have been in France or anywhere else late in
1092. And Henry may have had a time of distress and wandering
in the Vexin, either between March and August 1091 or at any
time in 1092. Where Orderic goes wrong, it is through forgetting
Henry’s visit to England in 1091, which was of no importance
to his story. He therefore naturally spreads the season
of wandering in the Vexin over the whole time from the surrender
of the Mount early in 1091 to the occupation of Domfront late
in 1092.</p>

<p class="p2">Robert of Torigny, in the Continuation of William of Jumièges
(<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 3), is in a still greater hurry to get Henry to Domfront (see
above, <a href="#Page_532"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 532</a>). The passage, as far as it concerns the relations
between Henry and Domfront, runs thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Comes Henricus, inde</span> [from the Mount] <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libere exiens, oppidum
munitissimum nomine Danfrontem sagacitate cujusdam indigenæ
suscepit. Indignabatur enim prædictus indigena, utpote
vir nobilis et dives, oppressiones amplius perpeti quas Robertus de
Belismo, homo ferox et mentis inhumanæ, sibi et aliis convicaneis
inferebat, qui tunc temporis illud castrum possidebat. Quod tanta
diligentia Henricus exinde custodivit ut usque ad terminum vitæ
illius in suo dominio habuerit.”</span></p>

<p>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“indigena nobilis et dives”</span> of this account is of course the
same as the Harecherius of Orderic. And the statement that
Henry kept Domfront all his days agrees with Orderic’s statement
about his promise. Wace (14762&ndash;14773) gives us some, perhaps
<a name="Page_539" id="Page_539"></a><span class="pageno">539</span>
legendary, details of the way in which Henry was brought from
Paris&mdash;&#8203;from the French Vexin, one would have thought, from
Orderic’s account&mdash;&#8203;to Domfront; but he is clearly wrong in
making any Robert, whether the Duke or him of Bellême, turn
Henry out of Domfront;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Ne coment Haschier le trova</div>
<div class="i0">A Paris donc il l’amena,</div>

</div>

<p>The covering of one of Henry’s eyes with pitch by way of disguise
may be believed or not; but the “savoir” of Haschier answers
to the “sagacitas” of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“indigena nobilis et dives.”</span> Passeiz,
Passais (see Pluquet, Wace, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 319; Neustria Pia, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 423), is the
district which contains Domfront and the abbey of Lonlay, a
district which lay in the ancient diocese of Le Mans, but which
was added to Normandy by William’s conquest.</p>

<p>This name “Haschier” or “Harecherius” is supposed by Le
Prévost (Pluquet, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 319) to be the same name as “Achardus,”
the name of one of the witnesses to the foundation charter of
Lonlay abbey in 1026. He signs as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Achardus dives, miles de
Donnifronte.”</span> This document is contained in an <dfn>inspeximus</dfn> of
Peter, Count of Alençon (1361&ndash;1377), contained in an <dfn>inspeximus</dfn>
of Henry, King of France and England about 1423 (Neustria Pia,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 424). The founder is the old William of Bellême, father of
William Talvas and grandfather of Mabel. There is a certain
interest in a document relating to Domfront and Lonlay before they
became Norman, when lands there could be granted <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“usque in
Normaniæ commarchiam.”</span> Among the signatures are those of the
founder’s brother Avesgaud Bishop of Le Mans (994&ndash;1036, see
<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume three page">N. C. vol. iii. p.</abbr> 191), Siegfried Bishop of Seez (1007&ndash;1026), the
founder and his wife, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Guillelmus princeps</span> [in the body of the
document he is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Guillelmus Bellismensis, provinciæ principatum
gerens”] et Mathildis uxor ejus,”</span> and this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Achardus <em>dives</em>”</span> whom
Le Prevost takes for a forefather of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“indigena nobilis et
<em>dives</em>.”</span></p>

<p>Orderic says that Henry obtained Domfront <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“suffragio amicorum.”</span>
Robert of Torigny, in the next chapter of his Continuation
<a name="Page_540" id="Page_540"></a><span class="pageno">540</span>
(<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 4), tells us who his friends a little later were. He is established
at Domfront; then we read;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Redeunte Willelmo rege in Angliam, Henricus haud segniter
comitatum Constantiniensem, qui sibi fraudulentia ante præreptus
fuerat, <em>consensu Willelmi regis</em> et auxilio Richardi de Revers et
Rogerii de Magna-villa, ex majori parte in ditionem suam revocavit.”</p>

<p>He then goes on with the passage about Earl Hugh and the grant
of Saint James to him, quoted in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 323.</p>

<p>I think that this distinct assertion that Henry was now in
William’s favour outweighs the vague expressions of Orderic about
Henry making war on both his brothers. By 1093, the earliest
date for these exploits, William was again scheming against Robert,
and his obvious policy would be to ally himself with Henry.</p>

<p>Henry, as we have seen in the extracts from Orderic, carried on
war in the usual fashion. But he at least treated his prisoners
better than Robert of Bellême did. We have (698 D) a picture of
one Rualedus&mdash;&#8203;a Breton Rhiwallon, or what?&mdash;&#8203;who is carried off
from the lands of Saint Evroul to the castle of Domfront. It was
winter; but he was not left to die of cold and hunger for Count
Henry’s amusement; we see him sitting comfortably by the fire
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quum sederet ad focum; hiems enim erat”</span>). On the road he
had fallen from the horse on which he was tied, and had suffered
some hurt. But, after prayer to Saint Evroul, followed by a comforting
dream, he wakes, and, as his keeper’s back is turned, he gets
up, unbars the door, walks into the garden, and, after some further
adventures, gets back to Saint Evroul. He was a man <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“legitimus
et laudabilis vitæ;”</span> so Orderic, who heard the story from his own
mouth, believes it. There seems no reason why anybody should
disbelieve it; as the only part of the tale which sounds at all incredible
is the very bad guard which Henry’s men kept over their
prisoner.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Homage of Malcolm in 1091.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> account of Malcolm’s homage to William Rufus which is
given by Orderic (701 A) is treated with some contempt by Mr.
<a name="Page_541" id="Page_541"></a><span class="pageno">541</span>
E. W. Robertson (Scotland under her Early Kings, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 142), while it
is naturally not forgotten by Sir Francis Palgrave (English Commonwealth,
<abbr title="two 332">ii. cccxxxii</abbr>). The main fact of the homage itself, paid
to the second William on the same terms on which it had been paid
to the first, is abundantly proved by the Chronicle. Nothing is
gained by disproving at this stage the exaggerated account of
Robert’s expedition in 1080 which is to be found in the local
History of Abingdon (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four pages">N. C. vol. iv. pp.</abbr> 671, 790). The only
question is, whether, accepting the general fact from the Chronicle,
we can or cannot accept any of the very curious details with which
Orderic tells the story.</p>

<p>First of all, while Orderic’s geography is right, his topography
is wrong. The mention of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“magnum flumen quod <em>Scotte
watra</em> dicitur”</span> must come from some genuine source. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ordericus
Angligena”</span> heard the tale from some one who told it him in
English. And, if there could be the shadow of a doubt, this
shows that “Loðene” in the Chronicle means Lothian, and nothing
else. Mr. Burton (<abbr title="History of Scotland one">Hist. Scot. i.</abbr> 412) insists on carrying Malcolm
to Leeds; but he cannot make the Aire to be the “Scotte watra.”
But Orderic, who plainly got his account from some quite different
source from the Chronicler, failed to take in the actual position of
the two armies. He failed to see that Malcolm, having crossed the
Scots’ Water into Lothian and therefore into England, was necessarily
on the south side of the Scots’ Water. He fancied that the
two kings were on opposite sides of the firth. William reaches the
Scots’ Water; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“sed, quia inaccessibilis transitus erat, super ripam
consedit. Rex autem Scottorum e regione cum legionibus suis ad
bellandum paratus constitit.”</span> So he doubtless did; only they
were both south of the water. The Chronicle shows plainly that
Malcolm, as soon as he heard of William’s coming, determined that
the invader should not, as his father had done, cross into the proper
Scotland to Abernethy or elsewhere, but that he would meet him,
for peace or for war, in the English part of his dominions.</p>

<p>This topographical confusion does not affect the main story,
nor does it greatly matter whether the picturesque details of
Robert’s visit to Malcolm literally happened or not. It is further
plain that Orderic has left out one of the two mediators, namely
Eadgar. But he records the main fact of the homage no less
than the Chronicler. The question is whether we can accept
<a name="Page_542" id="Page_542"></a><span class="pageno">542</span>
the curious conversation between Robert and Malcolm, in which
Malcolm makes two statements, which are perhaps a little startling
in themselves, which are not mentioned elsewhere, but which
certainly do not contradict what we find elsewhere.</p>

<p>First, Malcolm asserts that King Eadward gave him the earldom
of Lothian, seemingly as the dowry of Margaret; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Fateor quod rex
Eduardus, dum mihi Margaritam proneptem suam in conjugium
tradidit, Lodonensem comitatum mihi donavit.”</span> Now it is certainly
true that King Eadward, or Earl Siward in his name, gave
Malcolm the earldom of Lothian; only he gave him something
else too, namely the kingdom of Scotland. And I have mentioned
elsewhere (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 785) that a betrothal of Margaret
to Malcolm, when Malcolm received the kingdom from Siward,
though recorded nowhere else, is perfectly possible.</p>

<p>Secondly, Malcolm’s strong point is that he does owe a homage
to Robert, but that he owes none to William. This he asserts in his
first message; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tibi, rex Guillelme, nihil debeo, nisi conflictum si
a te injuriis lacessitus fuero. Verum si Robertum primogenitum
Guillelmi regis filium videro, illi exhibere paratus sum quicquid
debeo.”</span> Afterwards, in his conference with Robert, he is made
to say, after mentioning Eadward’s grant of Lothian, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Deinde
Guillelmus rex quod antecessor ejus mihi dederat concessit, et
me tibi primogenito suo commendavit. Unde quod tibi promisi
conservabo. Sed fratri tuo nihil promisi et nihil debeo. Nemo,
ut Christus ait, potest duobus dominis servire.”</span> To this Robert
agrees; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ut asseris, ita est. Sed mutationes rerum factæ sunt,
et statuta patris mei a pristina soliditate in multum vacillaverunt.”</span>
I do not know that a homage of Malcolm to Robert is recorded
anywhere else, unless we so understand the confused Abingdon story
about the expedition of 1080. But nothing was more likely than
that William the Conqueror should at Abernethy call on Malcolm
to pledge himself, as was so often done, not only to himself but
to his son after him. In 1072 there could have been no reason
for looking to any one but Robert as the probable successor; least
of all could any one have thought of William the Red. He was
not even the second son, as Richard was still alive. And the time
when King William renewed the gift of his predecessor Eadward
must surely be the day of Abernethy, and none other.</p>

<p>There is then really nothing in Orderic’s story which gainsays
<a name="Page_543" id="Page_543"></a><span class="pageno">543</span>
any known facts, and it is hard to see what should have made
him think of a betrothal of Margaret, a homage to Robert, and
the rest, unless he had some ground for them. And the general
argument put into Malcolm’s mouth seems exactly in place. It
is of a piece with the arguments of Scottish disputants long after
Orderic’s day. Something is admitted, that something is perhaps
specially insisted on, in order to avoid the admission of something
else. Lothian is the special personal gift of Eadward to Malcolm
himself, though it is certain, on any view of the cession of Lothian,
that predecessors of Malcolm had held it of predecessors of Eadward.
That gift of Eadward, renewed by William the Great, is
allowed to carry with it a personal duty to William the Great and
to his personal heir. But the denial of any duty to William the
Red implicitly denies any duty to the King of the English as such.
Still this question is in words left open; so is all that relates to
the proper Scotland left open. Malcolm at last consents to do
homage to William for something; but, in Orderic’s story at least,
it is not very clear for what. (The Chronicler, we may be sure,
felt so certain of its being for Scotland that he did not think it
needful to say so.) All this is exactly like later controversies on
the same subject. When the two kingdoms were on friendly terms,
it often suited both sides that the homage should be general,
leaving it open to each side to assert its own doctrine the next
time there should be any dispute (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 209). And
we must remember that by this time it is quite possible that
Rufus might make claims which Malcolm would, on the principles
of an earlier time, do quite right in refusing. Strictly feudal
ideas were growing, and when a King of the English demanded
homage for the kingdom of Scotland, he may well have meant
more than had been meant when the king and people of the Scots
sought Eadward the Unconquered to father and lord. Certainly,
when the whole thing had stiffened into a question of ordinary
feudal law, Edward the First, if judged by the standard of the
tenth century, asked more than his historic rights over Scotland,
less than his historic rights over Lothian. See Historical Essays,
Series I. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 65; <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume one page">N. C. vol. i. p.</abbr> 128.</p>

<p class="p2">I am therefore inclined to believe that Orderic has, in this
case, as in some others, incidentally preserved facts of which we
<a name="Page_544" id="Page_544"></a><span class="pageno">544</span>
have no record elsewhere. But I am not anxious strongly to
insist upon this. The general course of the history is the same,
whether Margaret had or had not been betrothed to Malcolm
before his marriage&mdash;&#8203;or whatever it was&mdash;&#8203;with Ingebiorg; it is
the same whether Malcolm had or had not done an act of homage
to Robert. And I must allow that, as Orderic has misunderstood
some points at the beginning of the story, so he has more thoroughly
misunderstood some points at the end of the story. For he makes
Malcolm go into England&mdash;&#8203;Florence would have said into Wessex&mdash;&#8203;with
William and Robert; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Deinde reges agmina sua remiserunt,
et ipsi simul in Angliam profecti sunt.”</span> This comes, as we shall
presently see, from rolling together the events of the years 1091
and 1093.</p>

<p class="p2">The twelve “villæ” which, according to Florence, were to be
restored to Malcolm are, I suppose, the same as the “mansiones”
which the kings of Scots are said to have held in England in times
both earlier and later than those with which we are dealing. This
comes from Roger of Wendover’s account (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 416; <abbr title="compare Norman Conquest volume one page">cf. N. C. vol. i. p.</abbr>
584) of the grant of Lothian by Eadgar to Kenneth. It was given
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“hac conditione, ut annis singulis in festivitatibus præcipuis, quando
rex et ejus successores diadema portarent, venirent ad curiam, et cum
cæteris regni principibus festum cum lætitia celebrarent; dedit insuper
ei rex mansiones in itinere plurimas, ut ipse et ejus successores
ad festum venientes ac denuo revertentes hospitari valuissent, quæ
usque in tempora regis Henrici secundi in potestate regum Scotiæ
remanserunt.”</span> The slighter mention in Florence gives some confirmation
to the story in Roger. And though it was not likely that
the King of Scots, or even the Earl of Lothian, should regularly
attend at the great festivals, yet it was doubtless held that it
was the right thing that he should do so; and we find Malcolm
himself coming to the King’s court not long after (see <a href="#Page_13"><abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 13</a>),
and his son Eadgar after him (see <a href="#Page_265"><abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 265</a>).</p>

<p class="p2">There is not much to be got from the other writers. William
of Malmesbury twice refers to the matter, but as usual without
much regard to chronology. It is seemingly this submission of
Malcolm to which he refers in <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 250, where, having said that
Malcolm, in the days of the elder William, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“incertis et sæpe
fractis fœderibus ævum egit,”</span> adds <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“filio Willelmi Willelmo</span>
<a name="Page_545" id="Page_545"></a><span class="pageno">545</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">regnante, simili modo impetitus, falso sacramento abegit.”</span> He must
also refer to this time in <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 310&ndash;311, where he says that, after
the siege of Saint Michael’s Mount, he went back to England,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quod eum Scottorum et Walensium tumultus vocabant.”</span> There
was (see <a href="#Page_78"><abbr title="volume two  pages">vol. ii. pp.</abbr> 78</a>, <a href="#Page_79">79</a>) a considerable <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Walensium tumultus”</span>
this year; but it does not seem that the King himself did anything
in those parts till later in his reign. William however says;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Primo contra Walenses, post in Scottos, expeditionem movens,
nihil magnificentia sua dignum exhibuit, militibus multis desideratis,
jumentis interceptis.”</p>

<p>He then goes on to speak more at large of Welsh matters, and
comes back to speak of the action of Robert in Scotland (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 301).
The old friendship which he there speaks of between Malcolm and
Robert falls in with Orderic’s story, and specially with Orderic’s
way of telling it. We shall hear of it again in <a href="#Note_BB">Notes BB</a>, <a href="#Note_EE">EE</a>.</p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon (<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 216) tells the story thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Interea Melcolm rex Scotorum prædatum veniens in Angliam
validissime vexavit eam. Venientes igitur in Angliam rex, et cum
eo Robertus frater suus, direxerunt acies in Scotiam. Itaque Melcolm,
nimio terrore perstrictus, homo regis effectus est et juramento
fidelitatis ei subjectus.”</span> Matthew Paris (<abbr title="Historia Anglorum">Hist. Angl.</abbr> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 40) has a
wonderful version in which the invasion is altogether left out.
Malcolm, hearing of the peace between the brothers, begins to fear
for his own kingdom. He therefore comes to William and makes
a very humble homage indeed; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Veniens ad regem Angliæ Willelmum,
humilitate sua regis flexit ferocitatem, asserens se nullum
hostium suorum receptasse vel recepturum fore, nisi tali intentione,
ut ipsos dominum suum recognoscentes, regi, persuasionibus suis
mediantibus, redderet pacificatos et fideliores.”</span></p>

<p class="center sc">The Earldom of Carlisle.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is certainly a singular fact that, so lately as 1873, a long controversy
raged in the Times newspaper as to the reason why Cumberland
and Westmoreland were not surveyed in Domesday. The
dispute was kept up for some time among men who seemed to have
<a name="Page_546" id="Page_546"></a><span class="pageno">546</span>
some local knowledge; but, till Dr. Luard kindly stepped in to
set them right, every reason was guessed at but the true one. No
one seemed to grasp the simple facts, that no part of England
was known at the time of the Survey by the name Cumberland
or Westmoreland&mdash;&#8203;that so much of the shires now bearing those
names as then formed part of the kingdom of England is surveyed
under the head of Yorkshire&mdash;&#8203;that the reason why the rest is left
unsurveyed is because it formed no part of the kingdom of England.
The whole matter had long before been thoroughly sifted and set right
by two local writers, who, I am tempted to suspect, were only one
writer; yet the received local confusions were just as strong as ever.</p>

<p>The general history of Cumberland, and of this part of it in
particular, was very minutely examined in the Introduction to the
volume published in 1847 by the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle-upon-Tyne
under the name of “The Pipe-Rolls or Sheriffs’ Annual
Accounts of the Revenues of the Crown for the Counties of Cumberland,
Westmorland, and Durham, during the Reigns of Henry <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>,
Richard <abbr title="One">I</abbr>, and John.” After this, in 1859, a paper was read by
Mr. Hodgson Hinde at the Carlisle meeting of the Archæological
Institute, “On the Early History of Cumberland,” which appeared
in the Archæological Journal, <abbr title="volume 16 page">vol. xvi. p.</abbr> 217. These two essays
have pretty well exhausted the piece of Cumbrian history with
which I have now to deal, and they contain a great deal more with
which I am not concerned.</p>

<p class="p2">The word <dfn>Cumberland</dfn>, I need not say, is a word of many meanings,
and at the present moment we have not to do with any of them.
We have to do only with the city and earldom of <dfn>Carlisle</dfn>, which
does not answer to Cumberland in either the older or the later
sense. The confusion which has immediately to be got rid of is
the notion that Carlisle and its district already formed an English
earldom in the time of the Conqueror. Thus we read in Sir Francis
Palgrave (English Commonwealth, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 449);</p>

<p class="blockquote">“‘Cumberland’&mdash;&#8203;for we must now call the Dominion by its modern
appellation&mdash;&#8203;was, as I have observed, retained by the Conqueror;
Malcolm had invaded the country; but he could not defend the
territory against William, who granted Cumberland to Ranulph de
Meschines, one of his Norman followers; and the border Earldom
became wholly assimilated, in its political character, to the other
<a name="Page_547" id="Page_547"></a><span class="pageno">547</span>
great baronies of England…. Carlisle was always excepted from
these grants. The city, and the territory of fifteen miles in circuit,
had become English by Ecgfrid’s donation, and probably was always
held, either by the Kings or Earls of Bernicia or of Northumbria.
Little further is known concerning ‘merry Carlisle,’ the seat of
Arthur’s chivalry. Until the reign of William Rufus, this city,
desolated by the Danes, was almost void of inhabitants. William
completed the restoration of its walls and towers, which his father
had begun.”</p>

<p>This comes primarily from a passage in the so-called Matthew of
Westminster under the year 1072;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex Gulihelmus cum grandi exercitu Scotiam ingressus est, et
obviavit ei pacifice Malcolmus rex Scotorum apud Barwicum et
homo suus devenit. His temporibus regebat comitatum Carleoli
comes Ranulphus de Micenis, qui efficax auxilium præbuit regi
Gulihelmo in conquestu suo Angliæ. Hic urbem Carleoli cœpit
ædificare, et cives ejusdem plurimis privilegiis munire. Sed rediens
rex Gulihelmus a Scotia per Cumbriam, videns tam regale municipium,
abstulit illud a Ranulpho comite, et dedit illi pro eo comitatum
Cestriæ, multis honoribus privilegiatum. Carleolum vero
precepit rex Gulihelmus turribus propugnaculisque muniri firmissimis.
Rex vero Gulihelmus Conquestor in redeundo de Scotia
apud Dunelmum novum ibidem construxit castellum contra irruptiones
Scotorum.”</p>

<p>There is also printed in the Monasticon, <abbr title="volume three page">vol. iii. p.</abbr> 584, a genealogical
document called “Chronicon Cumbriæ,” which comes
from the Register of Wetheral priory. This begins by saying
that</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex Willielmus, cognomine Bastardus, dux Normanniæ, conquestor
Angliæ, dedit totam terram de comitatu Cumbriæ Ranulpho
de Meschines, et Galfrido fratri ejusdem Ranulphi totum comitatum
Cestriæ, et Willielmo fratri eorundem terram de Copland, inter
Duden et Darwent.”</p>

<p>The source of error here is that Matthew of Westminster, so to
call him, mixed up the Scottish expedition of the Conqueror in
1072 with the Scottish expedition of William Rufus in 1091, and
made the restoration of Carlisle a work of the father and not of the
son. He also brings in Earl Randolf, with whom we are not as yet
concerned; but it is to be noticed that he says nothing about an
<a name="Page_548" id="Page_548"></a><span class="pageno">548</span>
earldom of <em>Cumberland</em>, but speaks only of an earldom of <em>Carlisle</em>.
It is only in the Wetheral document that an earldom of <em>Cumberland</em>
is carried back to the days of the Conqueror. Sir Francis Palgrave
failed to notice this distinction; but he knew his books far too well
to pass by the entries in the Chronicle and Florence under 1092.
He therefore tried to reconcile them with the passages in Matthew
of Westminster and the Wetheral chronicle by supposing an
earldom of Cumberland which did not take in Carlisle and its
district. The error and its source were first pointed out by Lappenberg
(<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 175 of the German original, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 234 of Mr. Thorpe’s
Anglo-Norman Kings, where, as usual, some of Lappenberg’s notes
and references are left out). Lappenberg notices the difference
between Matthew’s story and Palgrave’s; he suggests that Matthew
has further confounded the events of 1072 and 1092 with those of
1122; and he gives a summary of the whole matter in the words;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Wichtig aber ist es wahrzunehmen, dass erst Rufus und nicht
sein Vater Cumberland zu einer wirklichen Provinz des normannischen
Englands machte.”</p>

<p>Here is the root of the matter, so far as we have got rid of the
notion of the Conqueror having done anything at Carlisle or thereabouts.
Still Lappenberg should not have spoken, as I myself
ought not to have spoken (<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 118), of <em>Cumberland</em> now
becoming an English earldom. The district with which we are
concerned forms only a very small part of the old kingdom of
Cumberland, while it does not answer to the modern county of
Cumberland, which does not appear by that name till 1177 (see
Pipe Rolls of Cumberland, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 18; Archæological Journal, <abbr title="sixteen">xvi.</abbr> 230).
The land with which we are concerned bears the name of the city.
It is the land and earldom, not of <em>Cumberland</em>, but of <em>Carlisle</em>.</p>

<p>The point to be clearly taken in is that the district with which
we are concerned was not part of England till 1092; more accurately
still, it ceased to be part of England in 685, and became so again
in 1092. For those four centuries, Carlisle, city and district, had
as much or as little to do with England as the lands immediately to
the north of it, the lands which formed that part of Cumberland in
the wider sense which became in the end part of the kingdom of
Scotland. This district of Carlisle does not answer to any modern
shire, and it is of course not surveyed in Domesday. But it does
answer to the diocese of Carlisle, as it stood before late changes.
<a name="Page_549" id="Page_549"></a><span class="pageno">549</span>
That diocese took in part of modern Cumberland and part of
modern Westmoreland. The rest of those shires, with Lancashire
north of Ribble and the wapentake of Ewecross (Pipe Rolls,
<abbr title="page 42">p. xlii</abbr>), formed the Domesday district of Agemundreness (see
Domesday, 301 <span class="decoration">b</span>), forming part of Yorkshire, as it formed part of
York diocese till the changes under Henry the Eighth. Mr. Hinde
suggests (<abbr title="Archælogical">Arch.</abbr> Journal, <abbr title="sixteen">xvi.</abbr> 227) that this district was conquered
by Earl Eadwulf, the great enemy of the Britons (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume one page">N. C. vol. i.
p.</abbr> 526), a position which it might be hard either to prove or to
disprove. Before the death of Henry the First, the Carlisle district
was divided into two shires, Carlisle and Westmoreland (<dfn>Chaerleolium</dfn>
and <dfn>Westmarieland</dfn>, Pipe Roll <abbr title="Henry One pages">Hen. I. pp.</abbr> 140, 143). This
last consisted of the barony of Appleby, specially known as Westmoreland.
Enlarged by the barony of Kirkby Kendal in Yorkshire,
it became the modern county of Westmoreland. So the shire of
Carlisle took the name of <dfn>Cumberland</dfn> in 1177, and, enlarged by the
part of Yorkshire north of the Duddon, it became the modern county
of Cumberland. But these added lands remained part of the diocese
of York, till Henry the Eighth removed them to his diocese of
Chester. This last diocese must not be confounded with the diocese
of Chester&mdash;&#8203;otherwise of Lichfield or Coventry&mdash;&#8203;with which
we have to do in our story. That diocese did not reach north
of the Ribble, and its seat at Chester was in Saint John’s minster,
while the new see of Henry the Eighth was planted in Saint
Werburh’s.</p>

<p>The earldom of Carlisle brings us among old acquaintances.
It was granted early in the reign of Henry the First (see <abbr title="Archælogical">Arch.</abbr>
Journal, <abbr title="sixteen">xvi.</abbr> 230, 231) to Randolf called Meschines, <em>de Micenis</em>,
and other forms, who in 1118 became Earl of Chester, on the death
of Earl Richard in the White Ship (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 195), on
which he gave up Carlisle. He died in 1129, being the second
husband of the younger Lucy (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume two page">N. C. vol. ii. p.</abbr> 682; <abbr title="volume three page">vol. iii.
p.</abbr> 778), daughter of Ivo Taillebois. Ivo himself, at some time
after the drawing up of Domesday (Carlisle Pipe Rolls, <abbr title="page 43">p. xliii</abbr>)
appears in the same part of the world as lord of Kirkby
Kendal. After 1118 the earldom of Carlisle or Cumberland remained
in the crown, till it was granted to David of Scotland in
1136 (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 259).</p>

<p>The name of the city and earldom of Carlisle is the best comment
<a name="Page_550" id="Page_550"></a><span class="pageno">550</span>
on its history. Alone among the names of English cities, it
remains purely British, not only in its root, but, so to speak, in
its grammar. The British idiom, I need hardly say, places the
qualifying word second; the Teutonic idiom places it first. Thus
<em>Caer Gwent</em> and <em>Caer Glovi</em> have become <em>Winchester</em> and <em>Gloucester</em>.
But <em>Caer Luel</em> has not changed; it remains <em>Carlisle</em>, and has not
become something like <em>Lilchester</em>. The reason is doubtless because
the first English occupation of Caer Luel did not last long enough
to give it a lasting English name. In 1092 nomenclature had
lost the life which it had in 685, and a foreign tongue moreover
had the upper hand. No one then thought of turning the name of
Carlisle about, any more than of doing so by the names of Cardiff
(Caerdydd), Caermarthen, or the Silurian <em>Caerwent</em> and <em>Caerleon</em>.</p>

<p class="p2">As for the colonists brought from the south, I have assumed
them to be a strictly Saxon element added to the already mixed
population of the border. And there may have been a Flemish
element too, as I was inclined to think when I wrote <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol.
v. p.</abbr> 119. The point is not of much importance, as the two
kindred elements would easily fuse together; but it strikes me
now that, if any part of the settlers had come from beyond sea,
the Chronicler would not have so calmly spoken of them as churlish
folk from the south. That phrase however is one well worthy
of notice. The words “hider suð” can hardly have been written at
Peterborough. That abbey certainly lies a long way south of
Carlisle; but Peterborough would hardly speak of itself in this
general way as “south.” (In 1051 Worcester, which lies south of
Peterborough, counted itself to be “at this north end”&mdash;“ofer
ealre þisne norð ende” says the Worcester Chronicle. See <abbr title="Norman Cnquest volume two page">N. C.
vol. ii. p.</abbr> 620.) The suggestion that these “churlish folk” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“multi
villani”</span> in the translation in the Waverley Annals) were the men
who had lost their lands at the making of the New Forest has high
authority in its favour. It seems to have been first made by Palgrave
(English Commonwealth, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 450), and it is supported by Lappenberg
(<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 175, Thorpe 235). Still it is a simple guess, and I cannot
say that to my own mind it has any air even of likelihood. It
arises, it seems to me, from an exaggerated notion of the amount of
havoc done at the making of the New Forest, combined with a
forgetfulness of the time which had passed since that event. We
<a name="Page_551" id="Page_551"></a><span class="pageno">551</span>
cannot fix its exact date, but the Survey shows that whatever
was done in the New Forest, much or little was fully done before
1085, and we are now in 1092.</p>

<p class="p2">The earliest official notice of Carlisle and Westmoreland, the
Pipe Roll of the 31st year of Henry the First, contains several
interesting entries. The city wall was building. There are
entries, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in operationibus civitatis de Caerleolio, videlicet in
muro circa civitatem faciendo”</span> (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 140), “in operatione muri
civitatis de Caerleolio” (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 141), and (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 142) “in liberatione vigilis
turris de Penuesel,” which needs a local expounder. Both in
this roll and in the rolls under Henry the Second we notice
a mixture of personal nomenclature, Norman, Danish, English,
and Scottish, which is just what we should look for. Distinctly
British names I do not see. In the first few pages of the roll
of 1156 we find at least three Gospatrics. One is very fittingly the
son of Orm; another is the son of Beloc (6), whose nationality may
be doubted; a third is the son of Mapbennoc, a clear Pict or Scot.
So again we have Uhtred son of Fergus (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 5), William son of
Holdegar, Æthelward [Ailward] son of Dolfin, hardly the dispossessed
prince. Swegen son of Æthelric [Sweinus fil. Alrici]
in the roll of Henry the First (142) is a local man; but Henry son
of Swegen, who comes often under Henry the Second, is the unlucky
descendant of Robert son of Wymarc. See <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 735.
There are a good many entries about the canons of Saint Mary
of Carlisle who were founded before the bishopric, in 1102 (see
Haddan and Stubbs, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 13). There is a notice in 1156 (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 3) of
the Bishop of Candida Casa or Whithern. That see was (Haddan
and Stubbs, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 25) revived about 1127, as suffragan of York, and
1156 is the date of the death of Æthelwulf the first Bishop of
Carlisle.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Early Life of Randolf Flambard.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I quoted</span> some of the passages bearing on the early life of
Randolf Flambard in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 521. I mentioned there that
he had a brother named Osbern, who appears in the Abingdon
<a name="Page_552" id="Page_552"></a><span class="pageno">552</span>
History. He had another brother Fulcher, of whom we shall
hear again. See <abbr title="Orderic Vitalis">Ord. Vit.</abbr> 788 D, and <abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 416. He had
also a son Thomas. I do not feel quite so sure as I did then,
or as Dr. Stubbs seems to be (<abbr title="Constitutional History one">Const. Hist. i.</abbr> 348), that he really
did hold lands in England <abbr title="Tempore Regis Edwardi">T. R. E.</abbr> The entry which looks like
it is the second of the three in Domesday, 51, which stands thus
in full;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Isdem Ranulfus tenuit in ipsa villa i. hidam, et pro tanto
se defendebat <abbr title="Tempore Regis Edwardi">T. R. E.</abbr> modo est tota in foresta exceptis <abbr title="4">iiii.</abbr> acris
prati terra fuit <abbr title="4">iiii.</abbr> carucatarum. Hæ duæ terræ valebant <abbr title="4">iiii.</abbr>
libras.”</p>

<p>It appears then that Flambard lost the arable part of this hide
at the making of the New Forest, as he also lost another hide,
with the same exception of four acres of meadow, which had been
held <abbr title="Tempore Regis Edwardi">T. R. E.</abbr> by one Alwold. A third hide, of which it is said
that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“duo alodiarii tenuerunt,”</span> he kept, as well as his holdings
in Oxford and Oxfordshire. Dr. Stubbs suggests that these lands
were “possibly acquired in the service of the Norman Bishop
William of London.” Sir F. Palgrave (England and Normandy,
<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 52) makes the most of this despoiling of a Norman holder.
But I am not clear that the words of the entry which I have
given in full necessarily imply that the land was held by Flambard
himself <abbr title="Tempore Regis Edwardi">T. R. E.</abbr> And, if we need not suppose this, his story
becomes a great deal simpler. Above all, we need no longer
suppose that a man who lived till 1128, and whose mother was
living in 1100 (see <a href="#Page_398"><abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 398</a>), had made himself of importance
enough to receive grants of land at some time before
1066.</p>

<p class="p2">The account of Flambard which is given by Orderic (678 C)
would certainly not suggest that he had been in England in the
time of Eadward;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hic de obscura satis et paupere parentela prodiit, et multum
ultra natales suos ad multorum detrimentum sublimatus intumuit.
Turstini cujusdum plebeii presbyteri de pago Bajocensi filius
fuit, et a puerilibus annis inter pedissequos curiales cum vilibus
parasitis educatus crevit, callidisque tergiversationibus et argutis
verborum machinationibus plusquam arti literatoriæ studuit. Et
quia semetipsum in curia magni regis Guillermi arroganter
<a name="Page_553" id="Page_553"></a><span class="pageno">553</span>
illustribus præferre ardebat, nesciente non jussus, multa inchoabat,
infestus in aula regis plures procaciter accusabat, temereque
majoribus quasi regia vi fultus imperabat.”</p>

<p>It is not easy to reconcile this with the version which makes
Flambard pass into the King’s service from that of Bishop Maurice,
who did not become bishop till Christmas, 1085. The story of
his service with Maurice appears in the account of him which is
printed in Anglia Sacra (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 705), and also along with Simeon (249 <abbr title="edit">ed.</abbr>
Bedford, and X Scriptt. 59). It is much more likely that the name
of the bishop should be wrongly given than that his service with
some bishop of London should be mere invention. If so, he may
have passed into the service of the Conqueror at almost any time of
his reign, while still so young that it becomes an easy exaggeration
on the part of Orderic to say that he was in the King’s service
from his childhood. The passage in the Life which continues
Simeon stands thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Fuerat autem primo cum Mauritio Lundoniensi episcopo; sed
propter decaniam sibi ablatam orto discidio, spe altioris loci se
transtulit ad regem.”</p>

<p>This must surely refer to something which really happened; and
in the Register of Christchurch Twinham (<abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum six">Mon. Angl. vi.</abbr> 303) we
distinctly read of Flambard, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“qui Randulphus antea fuerat decanus
in ecclesia Christi de Twynham.”</span> But this is directly followed by
another extract from the same register which denies that the heads
of the church of Twinham ever bore the title of dean, and which
connects Flambard with Twinham in quite another way. According
to this story, there were at Twinham in the time of William
Rufus twenty-four canons under a chief named Godric (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hunc
Godricum sui tunc temporis clerici, non pro decano, quasi nominis
ignorantes, sed pro seniore ac patrono venerabantur”</span>). Flambard,
already bishop of Durham, obtains a grant of Twinham and its church
from William Rufus (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Randulfus episcopus hanc ecclesiam cum villa
a rege Willielmo impetravit”</span>). If I rightly understand a very corrupt
text, Flambard enriches the church and designs to rebuild it,
and then to put in monks instead of canons; meanwhile he keeps
the prebends vacant as they fall in. This Godric opposes; but in
the end Flambard rebuilds the church, and keeps the prebends in
his own hands till there are only thirteen left. Then comes his
own banishment, and the grant of the church to one Gilbert de
<a name="Page_554" id="Page_554"></a><span class="pageno">554</span>
Dousgunels, after which Flambard seems to have had nothing more
to do with it.</p>

<p>It is odd that so many prebends should have become vacant in the
single year during which Flambard held the bishopric for the first
time, and one would not have expected him to have been a favourer
of monks. But I can get no other meaning out of the words
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“cupiens et disponens … præfatam ecclesiam … funditus eruere,
et meliorem decentioremque cuilibet ædificare religioni.”</span> What
comes after seems plainer still;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Fregit episcopus illius loci primitivam ecclesiam, novemque
alias quæ infra cimiterium steterant, cum quorundam domibus canonicorum
prope locum ecclesiæ cimiterii, et officinarum compenciorem
[?] faciendum et canonicis in villa congruum immutationem [sic]
ut dominus adaptavit locum. Fundavit equidem hanc ecclesiam
episcopus Randulfus quæ nunc est apud Twynham, et domos et
officinas cuilibet religioni. Obeunte canonicorum aliquo, ejus beneficium
in sua retinebat potestate, nulli tribuens alii, volens unamquamque
dare præbendam religioni, si eos omnes mortis fortuna
in suo tulisset tempore.”</p>

<p>Now all this can hardly have happened between Flambard’s consecration
in 1099 and his imprisonment in 1100. But he may
have had the grant of Twinham before he was bishop. Again, in
two charters (<abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum six">Mon. Angl. vi.</abbr> 304), granted by the elder Baldwin
of Redvers, we hear of deans of Twinham and of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ranulfus decanus,”</span>
which seems to mean Flambard himself. The lands of the
canons of Twinham are entered in Domesday, 44; but there is no
mention of Flambard.</p>

<p>We thus have the absolutely certain fact that Flambard held
lands near Twinham. In two independent sources he is said to
have been dean of Twinham. In another independent source he
is said to have held and lost some deanery not named. In yet
another story he is described, not as dean of Twinham, but as
doing great things at Twinham in another character. These
accounts cannot literally be reconciled; but they certainly point
to a connexion of some kind between him and the church of
Twinham.</p>

<p>We must indeed mourn the loss of the primitive church of
Twinham with its nine surrounding chapels, something like Glendalough
or Clonmacnois. The nave of the present church may well
<a name="Page_555" id="Page_555"></a><span class="pageno">555</span>
be Flambard’s work; but it has no special likeness to his work at
Durham. But this may only prove that he built it before he went
to Durham, and there learned the improvements in architecture
which had been brought in by William of Saint-Calais (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C.
vol. v. p.</abbr> 631). The seculars of Twinham made way for Austin
canons about 1150.</p>

<p>While speaking of Twinham, I must correct a statement which
I made long ago with regard to one of the chief worthies of my
earlier story. I said (<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume two page">N. C. vol. ii. p.</abbr> 33) that Earl Godwine was
“nowhere enrolled among the founders or benefactors of any
church, religious or secular.” I find him enrolled among the benefactors
of Twinham. And here again we mark that, as with his
wife (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume volume two page">N. C. vol. ii. p.</abbr> 358) and his son, his bounty goes to the
seculars. The passage, in one of the charters of the elder Baldwin
of Redvers granted to Hilary Dean of Twinham (<abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum six">Mon. Angl. vi.</abbr> 304),
stands thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ecclesiam de Stoppele cum omnibus quæ ad eam spectant;
unam virgatam terræ cum appendiciis in eadem villa <em>ex dono
Godwini comitis</em>, quam Orricus de Stanton eidem Christi ecclesiæ
violenter surripuit.”</p>

<p>I cannot identify this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Orricus de Stanton”</span> in Domesday, nor
do I know anything as to the genuineness of the charter. But
no one in the twelfth century or later would be likely to invent a
benefaction of Earl Godwine.</p>

<p class="p2">Orderic, in the passage quoted above (678 C), distinctly speaks of
Randolf as having been in the service of the Conqueror, and it must
have been in his court that he got the surname which, in so many
forms, has stuck to him, and which we find even in Domesday (see
<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 521). The way in which he came by it is thus
described&mdash;&#8203;his false accusations have just been mentioned;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Unde a Roberto dispensatore regio Flambardus cognominatus
est, quod vocabulum ei secundum mores ejus et actus quasi prophetice
collatum est. Flamma quippe ardens multis factis intulit
genti novos ritus, quibus crudeliter oppressit populorum cœtus, et
ecclesiæ cantus temporales mutavit in planctus.”</p>

<p>In this last piece of rhetoric we seem to lose the real reason why
he was called <em>Flambard</em>, which is not very clear: still less do we
get any explanation of the form “<em>Passe</em>flambard.” Lappenberg
<a name="Page_556" id="Page_556"></a><span class="pageno">556</span>
(<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 167) says <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“er habe den Beinamen von der Fackel wegen seiner
schon früh bewährten Habsucht erhalten.”</span> But one has some
fellow-feeling with his translator (225)&mdash;&#8203;if he would only have
written English to match Lappenberg’s German&mdash;“It is not easy
to conceive how the sobriquet of <em>Flambeau</em> could be given to an
individual on account of his covetousness.” Nor is it quite clear
that it is covetousness strictly so called of which Orderic speaks. He
says elsewhere (786 D); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Erat sollers et facundus, et, licet crudelis
et iracundus, largus tamen et plerumque jocundus, et ob hoc plerisque
gratus et amandus.”</span></p>

<p>In a letter to Pope Paschal (<abbr title="Epistles four">Epp. iv.</abbr> 2) Anselm seems quite
carried out of his usual mildness of speech by the thought of Flambard,
especially by the thought of his being made a bishop. The
letter must have been written just after Paschal and Flambard
had received their several promotions. We get the same derivation
of the name as in our other extracts; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quando de Anglia exivi,
erat ibi quidem professione sacerdos</span> [see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 330], <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non solum
publicanus, sed etiam publicanorum princeps infamissimus, nomine
Ranulphus, propter crudelitatem similem flammæ comburenti, promine
Flambardus; cujus flamma qualis sit, non in Anglia solum,
sed in exteris regnis longe lateque innotuit.”</span></p>

<p>Lappenberg, in the passage quoted above, refers to Thierry’s wonderful
account of Flambard (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 141);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Renouf Flambard, évêque de Lincoln, autrefois valet de pied
chez les ducs de Normandie, commettait, dans son diocèse, de tels
brigandages, que les habitants souhaitaient de mourir, dit un ancien
historien, plutôt que de vivre sous sa puissance.”</p>

<p>I cannot find that Thierry speaks of Flambard anywhere else.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“valet de pied”</span> must come from the bit in Orderic about
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pedissequi curiales.”</span> The rest, including the wonderful confusion
which makes him bishop of Lincoln, comes, as Lappenberg
points out, from a passage in the Winchester Annals, 1092 (<abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr>
1097), which I shall presently have to refer to. But it is really
amazing that Flambard’s loss of property in the New Forest
did not cause him to be brought in at some stage or other as
an oppressed Saxon.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Official Position of Randolf Flambard.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> exact formal position held by Flambard under William
Rufus has in some measure to be guessed at, as the rhetoric of
our authorities sometimes veils such matters in rather vague
language. Thus his biographer (Anglia Sacra, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 706) describes
him;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Admixtus enim causis regaliorum negotiorum, cum esset acrioris
ingenii et promptioris linguæ, brevi in tantum excrevit ut
adepta apud regem familiaritas totius Angliæ potentes et natu
quoque nobiliores illum superferret. Totius namque regni procurator
constitutus, interdum insolentius accepta abutens potestate,
cum negotiis regis pertinacius insisteret, plures offendere parvi
pendebat. Quæ res multorum ei invidiam et odium contraxerat.
Crebris accusationibus serenum animi regalis ei obnubilare, et
locum familiaritatis conabantur interrumpere.”</p>

<p>Here we have a vague description of a position of great influence,
without the bestowal of any official title whatever. Orderic (678 B),
in first introducing him, comes somewhat nearer to a formal description;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“His temporibus quidam clericus nomine Rannulfus familiaritatem
Rufi regis adeptus est, et super omnes regios officiales ingeniosis
accusationibus et multifariis adulationibus magistratum a
rege consecutus est.”</p>

<p>What then was the formal description of this office which set
its holder above all other officers of the King? Lappenberg (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>
168, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 226 of the English translation) and Stubbs (<abbr title="Constitutional History one">Const. Hist. i.</abbr>
347) both rule, and seemingly with good reason, that the office held
by Flambard was really that of Justiciar. Official names were at
this time still used so vaguely that it seems to be only in another
passage of Orderic (786 C, see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 559) that he is directly called so;
but, as Lappenberg says, his office is distinctly marked by the words
of the Chronicler (1099), when he says that the King “Rannulfe his
capellane þæt biscoprice on Dunholme geaf þe æror ealle his gemot
ofer eall Engleland draf and bewiste.” The same office seems to be
meant when Florence (1100) says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cujus astutia et calliditas tam</span>
<a name="Page_558" id="Page_558"></a><span class="pageno">558</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vehemens extitit, et parvo tempore adeo excrevit, ut <em>placitatorem</em>
ac totius regni <em>exactorem</em> rex illum constitueret.”</span> Henry of Huntingdon
uses the same word, when (<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 21, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 232 <abbr title="edited">ed.</abbr> Arnold) he seems
to be translating the entry in the Chronicle; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Anno illo [1099]
rex Ranulfo <em>placitatori</em> sed perversori, <em>exactori</em> sed exustori, totius
Angliæ, dedit episcopatum Dunhelme.”</span> Florence himself, in his
entry under the same year, calls him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rannulfus, quem negotiorum
totius regni <em>exactorem</em> constituerat.”</span> (In 1094 he is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rannulphus
<em>Passe</em>flambardus.”</span>) Dr. Stubbs (<abbr title="Constitutional History one">Const. Hist. i.</abbr> 348) remarks that
these “expressions recall the ancient identity of the <em>gerefa</em> with the
<em>exactor</em>, and suggest that one part of the royal policy was to entrust
the functions which had belonged to the præfectus or high steward
to a clerk or creature of the court.” In the Gesta Pontificum (274)
William of Malmesbury, like the Biographer, calls him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“totius
regni <em>procurator</em>;”</span> in Eadmer (<abbr title="Historia novorum">Hist. Nov.</abbr> 20), he is more vaguely
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ranulfus regiæ voluntatis maximus <em>executor</em>.”</span></p>

<p>We have seen that Randolf Flambard was a priest (see above,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 556), and he is spoken of in a marked way as the King’s chaplain.
His biographer (<abbr title="Anglia Sacra one">Angl. Sac. i.</abbr> 706) says that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“propter quandam apud
regem excellentiam, singulariter nominabatur capellanus regis.”</span>
And we have seen that he is so called in the Chronicle. The word
is found in only one other place in the Chronicle, namely in 1114,
where it is said of Thurstan Archbishop of York, “Se wæs æror
þæs cynges capelein.” We must remember that, with all the Red
King’s impiety and blasphemy, he seems never to have formally
renounced the fellowship of Christians, as he was never formally
cut off from it. But his choice of an immediate spiritual adviser
is at least characteristic.</p>

<p class="p2">Some of the passages describing the administration of Flambard
are of special importance. That given by William of Malmesbury
(<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 314) I have had occasion to quote piecemeal; but it may be
well to give it as a whole;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Accessit regiæ menti fomes cupiditatum, Ranulfus clericus, ex
infimo genere hominum lingua et calliditate provectus ad summum.
Is, si quando edictum regium processisset ut nominatum tributum

pauperum, confiscator alienarum hæreditatum. Invictus causidicus,

<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>The last words of this extract are of special importance (see
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 332). Florence (1100) speaks to much the same effect; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tanta
potestate adepta, ubique locorum per Angliam ditiores ac locupletiores
quosdam, rerum terrarumque ablatione, multavit, pauperiores
autem gravi injustoque tributo incessanter oppressit, multisque
modis, et ante episcopatum et in episcopatu, majores et minores
communiter afflixit, et hoc usque ad regis ejusdem obitum.”</span></p>

<p>Orderic, in his second description (786 C), thus speaks of
him;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hic nimirum de plebeia stirpe progressus Guillelmo Rufo
admodum adulatus est, et machinationibus callidis illi favens super
omnes regni optimates ab illo sublimatus est. Summus regiarum
procurator opum et justitiarius factus est, et innumeris crudelitatibus
frequenter exercitatis exosus, et pluribus terribilis factus est.
Ipse vero contractis undique opibus, et ampliatis honoribus, nimis
locupletatus est, et usque ad pontificale stemma, quamvis pene
illiteratus esset, non merito religionis, sed potentia seculari provectus
est. Sed quia mortalis vitæ potentia nulla longa est, interempto
rege suo, ut veternus patriæ deprædator a novo rege
incarceratus est.”</p>

<p>Henry imprisons him, he goes on to say, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pro multis enim
injuriis, quibus ipsum Henricum aliosque regni filios, tam pauperes
quam divites, vexaverat, multisque modis crebro afflictos irreverenter
contristaverat.”</span> The tradition of him in later times remained
to the same effect, as we see by the description of him in Roger of
Wendover (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 165), which is copied with some improvements by
Matthew Paris (<abbr title="Historia Anglorum one">Hist. Angl. i.</abbr> 182);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tenuit autem eo tempore rex in custodia Ranulphum, episcopum
Dunelmensem, hominem perversum et ad omne scelus pronum et
paratum, quem frater ejus rex Willelmus episcopum fecerat Dunelmensem
et regni Angliæ <em>apporriatorem</em> et potius subversorem, nam
vir fuit cavillosus. Qui cum regi jam dicto nimis fuisset familiaris,
constituerat eum rex W[illelmus], quia quilibet sibi similes
quærit questores, procuratorem suum in regno, ut evelleret, destrueret,
raperet et disperderet, et omnia omnium bona ad fisci
commodum comportaret.”</p>

<p>In this extract the “apporriator,” a queer word enough, but
<a name="Page_560" id="Page_560"></a><span class="pageno">560</span>
the meaning of which is plain, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“vir cavillosus,”</span> and the “quæstores,”
all come from Matthew’s own mint.</p>

<p class="p2">The Biographer of the Durham bishops has a story to tell of
Flambard at this time of his life. Some of those who had suffered
by his false accusations and his other devices, seemingly persons
about the court, make a plan to get rid of him altogether. A
certain Gerald undertakes the task. He meets the Chaplain&mdash;&#8203;Flambard
is so called in a marked way throughout the story&mdash;&#8203;in
London, and tells him a feigned tale that his old master Bishop
Maurice is lying at the point of death in one of his houses on the
banks of the Thames&mdash;&#8203;Stepney perhaps; it cannot be Fulham (see
Domesday, 127 <i>b</i>) as the story shows&mdash;&#8203;and wishes greatly to see
Flambard once more before he dies. He himself had been sent
by the Bishop with a boat to bring him with the more speed.
Flambard, suspecting no harm, enters the boat with a few followers.
The boat goes down the river to a distance which puzzles the
Chaplain, who is put off with false excuses. At last he sees a larger
vessel anchored in the middle of the stream, and clearly waiting
for his coming. He now understands the plot. He is carried into
the ship, which he finds full of armed men. With admirable
presence of mind, he drops his ring, and his notary (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“notarius
suus”</span>) drops his seal (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“sigillum illius”</span>), into the middle of the
river&mdash;&#8203;somewhat after the manner of James the Second&mdash;&#8203;that they
may not be used to give currency to any forged documents (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ne per
hæc ubique locorum per Angliam cognita, simulata præcepta hostibus
decipientibus transmissa rerum perturbarent statum”</span>). Then his
men are allowed to go on shore, on taking an oath that they will
tell no one that their lord has been carried off. The ship puts out
to sea, and presently goes with full sail southward. The Chaplain
sits in the stern, while the sailors debate what kind of death he
shall die. Two sons of Belial are chosen, who, for the wages of the
fine clothes which Flambard has on, will either throw him into the
sea or brain him with clubs (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eliguntur duo filii Belial, qui illum
in fluctus projicerent, vel fracto fustibus cerebro enecarent, habituri
pretium sceleris optimas quibus tunc indutus fuerat vestes”</span>). The
would-be murderers dispute who shall have his mantle, and this
delay saves his life. By this time the wind changes; a storm comes
from the south, night comes on, the ship is dashed about hither
<a name="Page_561" id="Page_561"></a><span class="pageno">561</span>
and thither; there is no hope save to try to go back in the direction
by which they have come. At this point they again debate
the question of Flambard’s death. There is now a fear lest he
should escape and avenge the wrong done to him. But, as is usual
in such stories, one was found who was of milder mood; his name
is not given, but he held the place in the ship next after Gerald
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quidam secundus in navi a Geraldo tantum exhorrens scelus”</span>). He
is struck with remorse; he confesses his crime to Flambard, and
says that, if he will grant him his pardon, he will do what he can
for him and stand by him as his companion in life or death. Then
Flambard, whose spirit we are told always rose with danger, speaks
to Gerald in a loud voice; Gerald is his man, whose faith is pledged
to him; he will not prosper if he ventures on such a crime as this
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tunc ille, sicut magnanimus semper erat in periculis, ingenti
clamore vociferans, quid tu, inquit, Geralde, cogitas? Quid de
nobis machinaris? Homo meus es; fidem mihi debes; hanc violare
non tibi cedet in prosperum”</span>). He calls on him to give up his
wicked purpose; let him name his reward, and he shall have it;
he will give him his hand as a sign of his own good faith (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Pete
quantum volueris. Ego sum qui plura petitis præstare potero; et
ne discredas promissis, ecce manu affirmo quod polliceor”</span>). Gerald,
having less faith in his promises than fear of his power, agrees.
He goes back to the haven, and receives Flambard in his own
house near the shore (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ille non tam promissis illectus, quam
potentia viri exterritus, consentit, eductumque de navi jam in
portum repulsa honorifico in sua domo quæ litori prominebat
procuravit apparatu”</span>). But, still not trusting Flambard, he took
himself off for ever (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nequaquam credulus promissorum fugæ
præsidium iniens æterno disparuit exilio”</span>). Flambard goes back to
London with a great array (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ranulphus vero accitis undique
militibus multa armatorum manu grandique strepitu deducitur
Lundoniam”</span>). All are amazed to see him whom they had believed
to be dead. He takes his old place in the King’s counsels; he rises
higher in the King’s favour than ever, and no man dares to form
any more schemes against him as long as the King lives.</p>

<p>There seems no reason why this story should not be true;
true or false, it is characteristic. Just as in the later case of
Thomas of London, we see the greatness to which men of the
class of Randolf Flambard could rise&mdash;&#8203;their wealth, power and
<a name="Page_562" id="Page_562"></a><span class="pageno">562</span>
splendour, their numerous and even knightly following. One is
tempted to ask something more about Gerald the author of this
daring plot against Flambard’s life. Except that he is said to have
gone away for ever, one would be tempted to think that he must
be the same as Gerard&mdash;&#8203;the two names are easily confounded&mdash;&#8203;afterwards
Bishop of Hereford and Archbishop of York, a man
seemingly of much the same class and disposition as Flambard
himself, and who appears (see <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 524, 543) as a ready instrument
of the will of William Rufus.</p>

<p class="center sc">The alleged Domesday of Randolf Flambard.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I suppose</span> that the story about a new Survey of England,
to which Sir Francis Palgrave attached such great importance,
may be held to be set aside by the remarks of Dr. Stubbs, <abbr title="Constitutional History one">Const.
Hist. i.</abbr> 302, 348. He rules that in all likelihood Flambard had
a hand in the real Domesday, and that Orderic simply made a
mistake as to the date, which he is not at all unlikely to have
done. Long before Dr. Stubbs wrote, I had come to the conclusion
that the story in Orderic, as it stood, could not be accepted. It
is found in Orderic’s first account of Flambard (678 C), where he
tells us that he persuaded William Rufus to make a new Survey
of England. He measured, we are told, by the rope&mdash;&#8203;according,
as it would seem, to the measure of Normandy instead of the
measure of England&mdash;&#8203;in order in some way to increase the King’s
revenue. The words stand thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hic juvenem fraudulentis stimulationibus inquietavit regem,
incitans ut totius Angliæ reviseret descriptionem, Anglicæque
telluris comprobans iteraret partitionem, subditisque recideret, tam
advenis quam indigenis, quicquid inveniretur ultra certam dimensionem.
Annuente rege, omnes carucatas quas Angli hidas vocant,
funiculo mensus est et descripsit; postpositisque mensuris quas
liberales Angli jussu Eduardi regis largiter distribuerant imminuit,
et regales fiscos accumulans colonis arva retruncavit. Ruris
itaque olim diutius nacti diminutione et insoliti vectigalis gravi
exaggeratione, supplices regiæ fidelitati plebes indecenter oppressit,
<a name="Page_563" id="Page_563"></a><span class="pageno">563</span>
ablatis rebus attenuavit, et in nimiam egestatem de ingenti copia
redegit.”</p>

<p>I do not profess to know exactly what Flambard is here
supposed to have done. Sir Francis Palgrave goes into the matter
at some length, both in his English Commonwealth (<abbr title="two 447">ii. ccccxlvii</abbr>)
and in his History of Normandy (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 59). If I rightly understand
his meaning, the <em>carucata</em> in the valuation of the Conqueror was
not an unvarying amount of the earth’s surface, but differed according
to the nature of the land. A carucate of good land
would consist of fewer acres than a carucate of bad. Flambard,
we are to understand, measured out the land by the rope
into carucates of equal size, and exacted from each the full
measure of the geld. That is to say, an estate consisting mainly
of poor land would be reckoned at many more carucates, and
therefore would have to pay a much higher tax, than it had before.
I do not say that this may not be the meaning; but the words
of Orderic read to me as if they applied to an actual taking away
of land, as well as to a mere increase in its taxation. One might
almost fancy that, if a man had land of greater extent than
answered to his number of carucates according to the new reckoning,
the overplus was treated as land to which he had no legal claim,
and was therefore confiscated to the crown. But the real question
is whether anything of the kind happened at all. It is not mentioned
by any writer except Orderic, and it is the kind of thing
about which Orderic in his Norman monastery might not be very
well informed. It should be remembered, as Lappenberg (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 168
of the original, 226 of the English translation) remarks, that
Orderic makes no distinct mention of the real Domesday Survey,
and this statement may very well have arisen from a confusion
between the great Survey of the Conqueror and some of the local
surveys of which there were many. Sir Francis Palgrave believed
that he had found a piece of Flambard’s Domesday in an ancient
lieger-book of Evesham abbey, which the mention of Samson
Bishop of Worcester fixes to some date between 1096 and 1112.
Of the genuineness of the document there is no doubt; but I
cannot see, any more than Lappenberg did, any reason for supposing
it to be anything more than a local survey. The passage printed
by Sir Francis Palgrave, which he compares with the corresponding
part of the Exchequer Domesday&mdash;&#8203;to which it certainly has no
<a name="Page_564" id="Page_564"></a><span class="pageno">564</span>
likeness&mdash;&#8203;relates wholly to the two towns of Gloucester and
Winchcombe, so that it gives no means of seeing whether the
number of carucates in any particular estate differs in the two
reckonings.</p>

<p>I cannot believe with Lappenberg that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Henricus comes,”</span> who
appears among a crowd of not very exalted people as the owner
of one burgess at Gloucester, is the future King; it is surely Henry
Earl of Warwick.</p>

<p>Dr. Stubbs, while rejecting Orderic’s story altogether, further
rejects Sir Francis Palgrave’s explanation of it. He merely hints
that Orderic “may refer to a substitution of the short hundred
for the long in the reckoning of the hide of land.” But it is safer
to look, as he does, on the whole story as a misapprehension.</p>

<p>Of this way of measuring by the rope&mdash;&#8203;whence the <em>Rapes</em> in
Sussex&mdash;&#8203;several examples are collected by Maurer, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Einleitung zur
Geschichte der Mark- Hof- Dorf- und Stadtverfassung</span>, 72. 135. <abbr title="Compare">Cf.</abbr>
Herodotus, <abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 23; <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="ôrysson de hôde; dasamenoi ton chôron hoi barbaroi kata
ethnea, kata Sanên polin schoinotenes poiêsamenoi.">ὤρυσσον δὲ ὧδε· δασάμενοι τὸν χῶρον οἱ βάρβαροι κατὰ ἔθνεα, κατὰ Σάνην πόλιν σχοινοτενὲς ποιησάμενοι.</span>. In Sussex itself we
have (see above, <a href="#Page_68"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 68</a>) the story of the measuring of the <em>lowy</em> of
Lewes by the rope, which is at least more likely than the story
told by the same writer (Will. Gem. <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 15) that the earldom of
Hereford passed in this way to Roger of Breteuil; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cui comitatus
Herefordi funiculo distributionis evenit.”</span></p>

<p>The practice, in short, was so familiar that in the Glossary of
Rabanus Maurus (Eckhardt, Rer. Franc. Or. <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 963) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“funiculum”</span>
is explained by <em>lantmarcha</em> (<abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> Du Cange in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“funiculus”</span>). So Suger
(c. 15, Duchèsne, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 296) says how the Epte <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“antiquo fune geometricali

<p class="center sc">The Dealings of William Rufus with vacant
Bishoprics and Abbeys.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> chief point to be insisted on is that the appropriation of
the revenues of vacant bishoprics and abbeys by the King was
an innovation of William Rufus on the suggestion of Flambard.
Such a thing may possibly have happened before, though I am
<a name="Page_565" id="Page_565"></a><span class="pageno">565</span>
not prepared at this moment with an instance; but, if so, it was
merely a case of the irregular way in which Church property, and
all property, was often dealt with by those who had the power.
It was not a logical deduction from any legal principle, such as
it at once became when Flambard had established the doctrine
that the greater Church benefices were fiefs held of the King by
military service. The passage in the Chronicle which I have
quoted at <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 348 does not say in so many words that the practice
was an invention of Rufus or his minister, though the tone of
the passage certainly implies that their doings were something
new. Other writers speak more distinctly.</p>

<p>Next in authority to the Chronicler comes Eadmer, who is naturally
full on the subject. He tells us in detail (<abbr title="Historia novorum">Hist. Nov.</abbr> 14) how
Rufus dealt with the Church of Canterbury after the death of Lanfranc,
speaking more lightly of other cases as being of the same
kind;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cuncta quæ juris illius erant, intus et extra per clientes suos
describi præcepit, taxatoque victu monachorum inibi Deo servientium,
reliqua sub censu atque in suum dominum redigi jussit.
Fecit ergo ecclesiam Christi venalem: jus in ea dominandi præ
cæteris illi tribuens, qui ad detrimentum ejus in dando pretium
alium superabat. Unde misera successione singulis annis pretium
renovabatur. Nullam siquidem conventionem Rex stabilem esse
sinebat, sed qui plura promittebat excludebat minus dantem; nisi
forte ad id quod posterior offerebat, prima conventione vacuata,
prior assurgeret. Videres insuper quotidie, spreta servorum Dei
religione, quosque nefandissimos hominum regias pecunias exigentes
per claustra monasterii torvo et minaci vultu procedere, hinc inde
præcipere, minas intentare, dominationem potentiamque suam in
immensum ostentare.”</p>

<p>He goes on to tell of the sufferings of the monks and of their lay
tenants;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quidam ipsi ecclesiæ monachi malis ingruentibus dispersi ac
missi sunt ad alia monasteria, et qui relicti multas passi tribulationes
et improperia. Quid de hominibus ecclesiæ dicam qui tam vasta
miseria miseraque vastatione sunt attriti, ut dubitarem, si sequentia
mala non essent, an salva vita illorum possent miserius atteri.”</p>

<p>He then mentions the like dealings with other churches, and
adds the emphatic words;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566"></a><span class="pageno">566</span>
“Et quidem ipse primus hanc luctuosam oppressionem ecclesiis
Dei indixit, nullatenus eam ex paterna traditione excipiens. Destitutas
ergo ecclesias solus in dominio suo tenebat. Nam alium
neminem præter se substituere volebat quamdiu per suos ministros
aliquid quod cujusvis pretii duceret ab eis extrahere poterat.”</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 314) is no less distinct as to the
difference between the practice of the two Williams, and as to the
agency of Flambard. Having given his character of him (see above,
<a href="#Page_558"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 558</a>) he goes on;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hoc auctore sacri ecclesiarum honores, mortuis pastoribus,
venum locati; namque audita morte cujuslibet episcopi vel abbatis,
confestim clericus regis eo mittebatur, quo omnia inventa scripto
exciperet, omnesque in posterum redditus fisco regio inferret. Interea
quærebatur quis in loco defuncti idoneus substitueretur, non
pro morum sed pro nummorum experimento; dabaturque tandem
honor, ut ita dicam, nudus, magno tamen emptus.”</p>

<p>He then goes on to contrast in a marked way the conduct of
Rufus in these matters with that of his father; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hæc eo indigniora
videbantur, quod, tempore patris, post decessum episcopi vel
abbatis omnes redditus integre custodiebantur, substituendo pastori
resignandi, eligebanturque personæ religionis merito laudabiles; at
vero pauculis annis intercedentibus omnia immutata.”</span></p>

<p>Orderic has two passages on the subject. One of them (763 C)
is a mere complaint; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Defunctis præsulibus et archimandritis
satellites regis ecclesiasticas possessiones et omnes gazas invadebant,
triennioque seu plus dominio regis omnino mancipabant. Sic nimirum
pro cupiditate reddituum, qui regis in ærario recondebantur,
ecclesiæ vacabant, necessariisque carentes pastoribus Dominicæ
oves lupinis morsibus patebant.”</span> In the other (678, 679) he
distinctly speaks of Flambard’s innovation, and goes more at length
into the matter than any of the other writers. He has given one
of the descriptions of Flambard which has been already quoted
(see <a href="#Page_559"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 559</a>); and then goes on;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hujus consilio juvenis rex, morientibus prælatis, ecclesias cum
possessionibus olim sibi datis invasit, et tam in abbatiis cœnobitas
quam in episcopiis episcopales decanos et canonicos cuilibet satellitum
suorum subegit. Parcam autem ad victum suum distributionem
rerum eis delegabat, et reliquos redditus suæ ditioni
mancipabat. Sic avaritia regis in ecclesia Dei nimis exarsit, et
<a name="Page_567" id="Page_567"></a><span class="pageno">567</span>
nefarius mos, <em>tunc incœptus usque in hodiernum diem perseverans</em>,
multis animabus exitio fit. Hac enim de causa cupidus rex pastores
ecclesiis imponere differebat, et populus rectore et grex pastore
carens lupinis dentibus patebat, et multimodarum toxicatis missilibus
culparum sauciatus interibat.”</p>

<p>He then goes on to contrast the greediness and sacrilege of
William Rufus with the bounty of the ancient kings and nobles
from Æthelberht onwards. He again records and moralizes on
the special innovation of Rufus with regard to the treatment of
ecclesiastical properties during vacancies;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Antequam Normanni Angliam obtinuissent, mos erat, ut dum
rectores ecclesiarum obirent, episcopus cœnobiorum quæ in sua
diocesi erant, res sollicite describeret et sub ditione sua, donec
abbates legitime ordinarentur, custodiret. Similiter archiepiscopus
episcopii res, antistite defuncto, servabat, et pauperibus vel structuris
basilicarum, vel aliis bonis operibus, cum consilio domesticorum
ejusdem ecclesiæ distrahebat. Hunc profecto morem Guillelmus
Rufus ab initio regni sui persuasione Flambardi abolevit
et metropolitanam Cantuariæ sedem sine pontifice tribus annis
esse fecit ejusque redditus suis thesauris intulit. Injustum quippe
videtur, omnique rationi contrarium, ut quod Deo datum est
fidelium liberalitate principum, vel solertia dispensatorum ecclesiasticæ
rei laudabiliter est auctum, denuo sub laicali manu retrahatur,
et in nefarios sæculi usus distrahatur.”</p>

<p>One effect of this practice must have been to make the monks
and canons of the cathedral churches specially anxious to establish
their distinct property in some part of the estates of the local
church, separate from the property of the bishop. Under Flambard’s
system, all the estates of the church were during a vacancy
seized by the King, who allowed the monks or canons only such
a pittance as he thought good. When episcopal and capitular
estates were divided, when the body of canons held certain estates,
and each canon by himself held certain others, all in <em>frank-almoign</em>,
the seizure into the King’s hands of the estates which the bishop
held by military tenure made no difference to the incomes of the
canons.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Appointment of Herbert Losinga to the
See of Thetford.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> said something of the appointment of Bishop Herbert in
<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 420. The notices in our authorities are a little
puzzling. The Chronicle contains no mention of his appointment,
but we read in 1094 (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 448) of his staff being taken from him
by the King (“Herbearde Losange þam bisceop of Theotfordan
his stæf benam”). This passage, of which I shall have to speak
again, seems to have been misunderstood by a copyist of Florence,
who, instead of his genuine text, has inserted the words which I
have quoted in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol.iv. p.</abbr> 420. This account would imply that
Herbert bought both the bishopric for himself and the abbey for his
father in 1094. Then follows a passage which is found in nearly
the same words in both the works of William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="Gesta Regnum four">Gest.
Reg. iv.</abbr> 339; <abbr title="Gestis Pontificum page">Gest. Pont. p.</abbr> 151);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Verumtamen erroneum impetum juventutis abolevit pœnitentia,
Romam profectus severioribus annis; ubi loci simonicum baculum
et annulum deponens, indulgentia clementissimæ sedis iterum recipere
meruit. Domum vero reversus, sedem episcopalem transportavit
ad insignem mercimoniis et populorum frequentia vicum
nomine Nordevic, ibique monachorum congregationem instituit.”</p>

<p>This would place the journey to Rome after 1094. But there
can be no doubt that Herbert received the bishopric in 1091, and
that his repentance and journey to Rome took place between that
year and 1094. He signs as bishop the charter of Osmund
Bishop of Salisbury in 1091. And if any suspicion is thought to
attach to that instrument, the profession rolls at Canterbury, as
certified by Dr. Stubbs, are evidence enough of his consecration
and his profession to a future archbishop. His consecration by
Thomas of York is also recorded by T. Stubbs, Scriptt. 1707. The
true story is given in another manuscript of Florence, the reading
of which is given by Mr. Thorpe in a note, and in which the entry
of 1094 stands thus; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ubi etiam Herebertum, Theotfordensem
episcopum, pastorali baculo privavit. Latenter enim Urbanum
papam adire, et ab eo pro episcopatu quem sibi, et abbatiam quam</span>
<a name="Page_569" id="Page_569"></a><span class="pageno">569</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">patri suo Rotberto, ab ipso rege Willelmo mille libris emerat, absolutionem
quærere voluit.”</span> The case seems quite clear. Herbert
buys the bishopric of the King; he repents, goes to Rome, and is
reinvested by the Pope. The King looks on this as an insult to
the royal authority and takes his staff from him. But he must
have made his peace with the King within the next two years. For
at the end of that time he began the translation of his see from
Thetford to Norwich. The Annals of Bartholomew Cotton (Anglia
Sacra, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 397) give 1091 as the date of his appointment to Thetford,
1094 as the year of his translation to Norwich, and 1096 as the
beginning of the foundation of the church of Norwich. And it appears
from the local Annals of Saint Eadmund’s (Liebermann, 275)
that he was acting as bishop in East-Anglia, whether by the style
of Thetford or of Norwich, in 1095. I cannot help thinking that
the date assigned to the translation by Bartholomew Cotton is really
a confusion with the date of his temporary deprivation. In either
case he ceased to be Bishop of Thetford in 1094; most likely he
did not become Bishop of Norwich till 1096. It seems from the
Norwich documents in Anglia Sacra (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 397, 407; <abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum four">Mon. Angl. iv.</abbr>
13&ndash;15) that he began to build the church of Norwich in 1096,
and planted monks there in 1101. The local writers are full of
panegyrics on his virtues. His letters are printed in the series
called Scriptores Monastici, but they do not contain much that is
of importance for our history. He has a few correspondents with
English names, one of whom, Ingulf by name, was Prior of the
newly founded monastery of Norwich.</p>

<p class="p2">A third manuscript of Florence, the text of which is printed by
Mr. Thorpe in a note, seems to follow the version which was
acceptable at Norwich and leaves out the deprivation in 1094;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hoc anno [1094] venerabilis Herbertus, Theotfordensis episcopus,
a Roma cum benedictione apostolica rediit: et a Willelmo
rege impetravit ut sedes episcopalis in Norwicensi ecclesia firmaretur,
ubi ipse, Christi juvante gratia, pulcherrimam congregationem
monachorum ad honorem Sanctæ Trinitatis adunavit.”</span></p>

<p>The account in William of Malmesbury (Gesta Regum, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 338,
339) is evidently meant to make a striking rhetorical contrast
between the unregenerate Herbert who bought the see of Thetford
and the converted and sanctified Herbert who founded the church
<a name="Page_570" id="Page_570"></a><span class="pageno">570</span>
of Norwich. He becomes a special enemy of the simony which he
had himself once practised; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sicut tempore istius regis symoniæ
causidicus, ita posterius propulsator invictus, neque ab aliis fieri
voluit quod a se præsumptum quondam juvenili fervore indoluit.”</span>
His fuller picture in his earlier state is that he was “magnus in
Anglia symoniæ fomes, abbatiam episcopatumque nummis aucupatus;
pecunia scilicet regiam sollicitudinem inviscans, et principum
favori non leves promissiones assibilans.” Then follow the well-known
verses containing the lines</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="i0">“Surgit in ecclesia monstrum, genitore Losinga.</div>
<div class="i2"> … </div>
<div class="i0">“Filius est præsul, pater abbas, Symon uterque.”</div>
</div>

<p>William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 339) makes one very singular remark
in recording the restoration of Herbert to his see by the
Pope;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Iterum recipere meruit; quod Romani sanctius et ordinatius
censeant ut ecclesiarum omnium sumptus suis potius marsupiis serviant
quam quorumlibet regum usibus militent.”</p>

<p>The fling at Roman greediness is in the true English style of all
times; but, in the connexion in which it stands, the idea which it
suggests is that Herbert, who had once bought his bishopric of the
King, bought it again of the Pope.</p>

<p>On the name <em>Losinga</em> see De Rémusat, Anselme, 199; Diez,

<p class="center sc">The Letters of Anselm.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> letters of Anselm throw so much light on the events of the
time, they open to us so many bits of local and personal detail,
both in England and in Normandy, that we are not only thankful
for the help which they give us for this period, but sometimes
feel a certain grudge that we have no help of the same kind for
earlier periods. Anselm’s correspondents are found in all lands
and in all ranks. All his letters are of course in Latin, a tongue
which must, one would think, have in many cases needed to be
<a name="Page_571" id="Page_571"></a><span class="pageno">571</span>
interpreted to those to whom the letters came. A touch or two
in any natural language, whether English, French, or whatever
may have been the exact form of Romance spoken at Aosta, would
have been, not only a relief, but a precious source of knowledge.
But for this of course we must not look in these times, whether
from Anselm or from any one else.</p>

<p>In several places in the text I have used the letters of Anselm
among my most important materials. They form one of our
sources for the details of his own appointment to the archbishopric
(see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 400), while his correspondence with Cardinal Walter has
given us (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 537, and <a href="#Page_41"><abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 41</a>) some details not found elsewhere
with regard to the campaign against Robert of Mowbray. We
have also had, in one of his letters to Archbishop Hugh of Lyons
(<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 24, see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 419), Anselm’s fullest account of the questions which
led to the Assembly at Rockingham. The correspondence of course
goes on into the reign of Henry, and many of the letters which pass
between the King and the Archbishop are in fact state papers, and
are, as such, inserted by Eadmer in his history. The immediate
historical value of these belongs of course to a time later than
that dealt with in the present volume. But the whole series is
full of matter bearing on English affairs, and on the affairs of
other persons and places in which we are interested. I will
therefore go on to mention some of the matters connected with
our own and kindred subjects which are suggested by the letters
here and there. Many are addressed to Lanfranc, Gundulf, Priors
Henry and Ernulf of Canterbury, and others who play parts of
more or less importance in our story. A good many are to princes
of various lands, many to devout ladies, with the names of some
of whom, as those of Countess Adela, the daughter of the Conqueror,
and Countess Ida of Boulogne, we are already familiar. There
are also the special “ladies and mothers” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominæ et matres</span>)
of the church of Bec, who, without embracing the monastic profession,
had given themselves to a devout life under the shadow
of the monastery (Chronicon Beccense, Lanfranc, <abbr title="edition">ed.</abbr> Giles, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 202;
De Nobili Crispinorum Genere, <abbr title="ibid">ib.</abbr> 347; Anselm, <abbr title="Epistles two">Epp. ii.</abbr> 26, 51;
<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 138). These were Basilia the wife of Hugh of Gournay&mdash;&#8203;who
himself, with Hugh of Meulan, the father of the famous Count
Robert, became a monk at Bec&mdash;&#8203;her niece Amfrida, and Eva, the
widow of William Crispin. There are also a crowd of letters to
<a name="Page_572" id="Page_572"></a><span class="pageno">572</span>
prelates, nobles, monks, nuns, and persons of all kinds, which throw
incidental light on various points in the history of the time.</p>

<p>The close connexion between Bec and England comes out very
early in the series. It is perhaps not inappropriate that the
earliest mention of England concerns its money, which was so much
sought after beyond sea. This is in <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 13, where a moneyer of
Arras, who wishes to turn monk, but who has first to pay his
debts, is sent by Anselm, not yet abbot, to Lanfranc, already
archbishop, who will give him a hundred shillings of English
money towards paying them. In <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 15 he writes to Henry, seemingly
the future Prior of Christ Church, who was already in England,
with a piece of advice which we should hardly have expected from
Anselm. Being a monk, he is not to go into Italy to try to defend
his sister whom a certain rich man unjustly claims as a slave or
villain (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ire de Anglia in Italiam sororem tuam defendere, quam
audis quemdam divitem indebitæ servituti calumniose subjicere”</span>).
(It is less unreasonable when (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 127) he counsels the nun
Matilda not to go and visit her lay kinsfolk.) In another letter
(<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 35) Anselm speaks of the number of Normans who were
crossing into England, and how few of them there were whom he
could trust with a letter (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Licet multi Northmanni ad Anglos
transeant, paucissimi tamen sunt qui, me sciente, hoc faciant;
in quibus paucissimis vix est aliquis quem nostrum legationem
sine dilatione et non negligenter facturum confidam”</span>). This is
written to Maurice, a monk of Bec, who, with some others, had
moved to Canterbury. Of the English monks at Bec (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 65)
I have already said something (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 375). When Anselm becomes
abbot, and has to deal with the possessions of the monastery in
England, the references to English matters naturally thicken,
as in <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 3, 4, 5, 6. This last is addressed to Richard of Clare and
his wife Rohais or Rohesia, the daughter of Walter Giffard, of
whose name the old commentator Picard oddly says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“insuper
nomen Rohais pleno gutture personat Anglismum.”</span> The next
letter (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 7) shows that some of the Normans who passed into
England did not always choose the best parts of our character
to copy. For a monk named Henry is rebuked for drinking to
excess at gild-meetings. Here an English word thrusts itself in,
and we read, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“audio quia in multis inordinate se agit, et maxime
inbibendo, ita ut in <em>gildis</em> cum ebriosis bibat et cum eis inebrietur.”</span>
<a name="Page_573" id="Page_573"></a><span class="pageno">573</span>
In <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 9 Anselm records one of his own journeys to England, and
his reception at Lyminge by Lanfranc. We have more references
to his own English journeys and those of others in <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 13, 18, 19,
26 (a most remarkable one, of which I have spoken in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv.
p.</abbr> 440), 27, 30, 45, 46 (where he prays for the forgiveness of a
runaway monk called Moses of Canterbury), 47, 53.</p>

<p>Anselm’s letters as archbishop are of course yet fuller of the
English history of the time. The first part of the third book is
wholly taken up with the correspondence following on his appointment
to the archbishopric. The second letter in this book is a
most remarkable letter from Anselm’s friend Osbern (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 374)
strongly exhorting him to accept the archbishopric. He is not to
set up his own will against the will of the whole English Church
which calls for him as its chief;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ut enim in offenso dulcissimo mihi amore tuo loquar, aut
cunctis, quod non credimus, meliorem te fateberis, quippe cui soli
revelatum est quod universæ Anglorum ecclesiæ fas non erat
revelari; aut facias necesse est quod universalis Anglorum ecclesia
suadet, hoc est, ut pontificalis infulæ principatum inter beatos
apostolos sustinere non renuas.”</p>

<p>Osbern goes on to say that Anselm has already proof enough
that it is God’s will that he shall take the offered post. In so
doing, he gives a vivid picture of the circumstances of the appointment
and of the Red King’s momentary reform;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quid insignius ad te eligendum ostenderet Deus, quam, ut tu
promovereris, regem triumphis nobilem, severitate cunctis formidabilem,
lecto decubuisse, ad mortem usque ægrotavisse, te
autem provecto, statim eundem respiravisse, convaluisse, atque ex
fero et immani mitissimum pariter et mansuetissimum redditum
fuisse? Quid, inquam, aut effectum dulcius, aut ad innocentiam
præstantius, quam te ante lectum ægrotantis violenter pertractum,
dextram aliorum dextris impudenter de sinu abstractam, sinistram,
ne sororem juvaret, fortiter retentam, virgam, ceteris digitulis
pertinaciter occlusis, pollici atque indici crudeliter impactam, post
hæc toto corpore e terra te elevatum, episcopalibus brachiis ad
ecclesiam deportatum, ibique adhuc te reclamante, et importunis
nimis obsistente, Te Deum laudamus esse cantatum? Quid, inquam,
vel ad divinas laudes magnificentius vel ad humana spectacula gaudentius,
quam quod in tua electione, exclusis omnibus transactæ
<a name="Page_574" id="Page_574"></a><span class="pageno">574</span>
tempestatis afflictionibus, omnia ad proprii juris possessionem veluti
jubileo termino cucurrerunt, dum vincti ad expeditionem, carcerati
ad lucem, captivi ad libertatem, oppressi dirissimis exactorum
furoribus redierint ad erectionem.”</p>

<p>Osbern clearly had an eye for the comic element in the amazing
scene at Gloucester. He then goes on, among other things, to
enlarge on the dignity of the church of Canterbury. By a bold
figure, he conceives Anselm at the last day called before the judgement-seat,
because he had slain thousands of men, while seeking
for the safety of a few (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“cur non cogitabas infinita hominum
millia te occidisse, dum paucorum volebas saluti consulere”</span>). The
church of Canterbury, the bride of Christ, consecrated from the
beginning by the blessing of his Apostle Peter&mdash;&#8203;the same story
which we have heard at Westminster (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume two page">N. C. vol. ii. p.</abbr> 511),
and which is told in a slightly different, and still more daring,
shape at Glastonbury&mdash;&#8203;enriched by the privileges of so many popes,
and to which, saving the authority of the Roman church alone,
all the other churches round about were used to look for the defence
of their freedom (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ad quam, salva Romanæ et apostolicæ
sedis auctoritate, omnium circa regionum ecclesiæ in suis oppressionibus
confugere atque ab ea tuendæ libertatis præsidia expetere
simul ac suscipere solebant”</span>), now called on Anselm to come to the
succour of her liberties, and he refused. Osbern draws out this
bold metaphor at great length, and at last disposes of Anselm’s
scruples about his allegiance to the Norman Duke and to the church
of Bec (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“præmonstravi oraculis, comprobavi miraculis; verum tu
mihi prætulisti Normanniæ comitem, Deo vermem, viventi mortalem,
latitudini Anglorum angustæ solitudinis nidum”</span>). He
draws largely on Canterbury legends about Laurence and Dunstan,
in order to set forth that church as specially under the divine
favour. He, Anselm, had been called in a special way to be their
successor (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“cum neque sis privata gratia exhibitus, neque mercenarius,
neque Simonis discipulus, sed quem et divina vocavit
electio et apostolica informavit institutio”</span>), and that call he was
bound to obey.</p>

<p>The word “mercenarius” in the extract just made is perhaps
meant to contrast the palpable purity of Anselm’s nomination
with the appointment of those bishops who, whether they actually
bought their sees or not, at least received them us the reward of
<a name="Page_575" id="Page_575"></a><span class="pageno">575</span>
temporal services. There is another letter (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 5) from Osbern to
Anselm, which is simply an earnest prayer that he will no longer
put off his full admission to the archbishopric.</p>

<p>There are also several letters of Anselm (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 1, 4, 7), and one of
Gundulf (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 3), to the monks of Bec, to which some references
have already been made (see <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 405, 406). There is also one (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 6)
from the monks of Bec to Anselm, announcing their consent to
his acceptance of the archbishopric. It describes the division in
the convent, how each monk gave his vote at the call of the
president, whom, from this form of words, we may suppose not
to have been the prior (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“omnes in unum congregati sumus, unusquisque
nostrum de sua sententia ab eo qui præsidebat nominatim
est requisitus”</span>). The party which opposed Anselm’s removal is described
as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“suo potius quam vestro utens atque fidens consilio,
ardentiori, atque, ut sibi videtur, rectiori, amoris vestri zelo.”</span>
The monk Lanfranc, nephew of the Archbishop, a person who is
often mentioned in the letters, is to give Anselm a fuller account
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quæ pars alteram aut numero aut ratione præponderet, domnus
Lanfrancus, qui interfuit, et omnia hic apud nos gesta sive dicta
et vidit et audivit, plenissime per seipsum et sufficienter vobis
dicit”</span>). We have here a trace of that odd appeal from the “major
pars” to the “sanior,” which seems so utterly to upset every
notion of real election, but which is so often heard of in the
ecclesiastical debates of the time. The letter of the monks however,
though not very positively expressed, seems to have been
taken as a release. Other letters follow, in which Anselm recommends
(<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 8) William of Montfort (see Vitæ Abbatum Beccensium,
<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 313, Giles) as his successor in the abbacy, and commands the
Prior Baldric to keep his place, whoever may be chosen abbot. In
another letter (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 15) he announces to the monks his coming
consecration, and tells them that the King has promised to protect
all their rights in England as long as they live according to
Anselm’s counsel (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex Anglorum vobis mandat salutem et auxilium
suum et custodiam rerum vestrarum quæ sunt in sua potestate,
quamdiu meo consilio agetis et vivetis. Si autem illud
spreveritis, in illo proficuum non habebetis”</span>). He writes also
a letter (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 10) to Bishop Gilbert of Evreux, of whom we have
often heard, but who in Migne’s text is strangely changed into
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eboracensis episcopus,”</span> explaining his motives for accepting the
<a name="Page_576" id="Page_576"></a><span class="pageno">576</span>
archbishopric. He writes to the same effect (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 11) to Fulk Bishop
of Beauvais.</p>

<p>Once settled in the archbishopric, Anselm has to write about
other matters. The affairs of his province bring much correspondence.
Thus he writes (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 20) to Bishop Osbern of Exeter and his
canons on behalf of the monks of Battle (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“monasterium quod vulgo
dicitur de Batailla”</span>), who held the church of Saint Olaf at Exeter
(see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume two page">N. C. vol. ii. p.</abbr> 350, vol. <abbr title="four pages">iv. pp.</abbr> 166, 406; Eadmer, <abbr title="Historia novorum">Hist. Nov.</abbr>
64). He urges that they may be allowed to ring their bells. In a
letter (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 23) to Ralph Abbot of Seez, afterwards Anselm’s own
successor, we get a mention of Bishop Herewald of Llandaff (see
<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume two pages">N. C. vol. ii. pp.</abbr> 447, 692), who, it seems, like his brother bishop
Wilfrith of Saint David’s (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 534), had been suspended from the
episcopal office;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De fratre illo quem dicitis esse ordinatum a quodam episcopo,
quia a nobis est interdictus, hoc respondeo, quia si ordinatus est ab
episcopo de Walis, qui vocatur Herewardus, nec illis ordinibus,
quos ab illo accepit, nostra concessione aliquando utetur, nec ab
ullo episcopo reordinari debet.”</p>

<p>The same letter contains Anselm’s views, not on any matter
touching Norman or English history, but on a point of obvious
morality which had been dealt with long ago by the singer of the
Odyssey (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 260&ndash;263);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De altero vero fratre, qui herbas quæsivit mulieri, quibus
virum suum interficeret, quamvis prope vos habeatis de hac re in
Northmannia sufficiens consilium, tamen quia a me hoc petitis,
nostrum negare non debeo sensum. Si monachus noster esset, et
vir ille cujus morti quæsivit herbas ipsis interfectus esset, nunquam
ad diaconatum per me, vel ad sacerdotium ascenderet.”</p>

<p>Next follows the great letter to Archbishop Hugh of Lyons, to
which I have often referred; and not long after come the important
letters (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 35, 36), of which also I have often spoken. In <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 29
Anselm writes to Prior Henry and the rest of the monks of Christ
Church&mdash;&#8203;among them Anthony, Ernulf, and Osbern, all names
known to us&mdash;&#8203;charging them to leave off disputes, and to enforce
holy obedience. Next (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 30) comes a letter to Matilda Abbess
of Wilton (Wintoniensis in Migne), urging obedience to the diocesan
Bishop Osmund of Salisbury. The house of Saint Werburh at
Chester, in whose foundation Anselm had had a hand, comes in
<a name="Page_577" id="Page_577"></a><span class="pageno">577</span>
several times for his notice (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 34, 49). A crowd of letters bearing
on points in the history later than our time may be passed by, but
there are two very singular ones which throw a curious light on
English nomenclature. In <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 133 we have a letter thus addressed;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Anselmus archiepiscopus amico et filio carissimo Roberto, et
sororibus et filiabus suis dilectissimis Seit, Edit et Hydit, Luverim,
Virgit, Godit, salutem et benedictionem Dei et suam, si quid
valet.”</p>

<p>In the second letter, numbered in Migne <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 110, the heading
is, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Anselmus archiepiscopus, Roberto, Seyt, Edit, carissimis suis
filiis, salutem et benedictionem Dei, quantum potest.”</span> The persons
addressed seem to have been devout women of some kind, living
under the spiritual care of their confessor Robert. The letters
tell us nothing as to the position of the persons addressed; they
contain nothing but good advice which might be useful in any time
or place; but the names seem to have greatly perplexed the German
and French biographers of Anselm. Hasse (Anselm von Canterbury,
<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 502) says, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Interessant ist besonders ein Brief an die Nonnen
eines Klosters in Wales, wie es scheint,”</span> and he adds in a note;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Ich schliesse dies aus den Namen ‘Seit, Edit, Hydit, Luverim,
Virgit, Godit’ die in der Ueberschrift genannt werden. Ob es wohl
<em>weibliche</em> Namen sind? In dem Briefe <abbr title="5">v.</abbr> 16 [<abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> 110, Migne]
werden nämlich dieselben Personen als <em>filii</em> (wenn dies nicht ein
Druckfehler ist) angeredet, die hier [<abbr title="3">iii.</abbr> 133, Migne] <em>filiæ</em> heissen.
Ein <em>celtisches</em> Kloster war es jedenfalls; doch kann es auch in
Irland oder Schottland gewesen sein.”</p>

<p><abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> de Rémusat (<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselme de Cantorbéry, 177) had yet further
lights;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“On suppose qu’une lettre adressée à Robert <em>son ami et son fils
très cher, et à ses sœurs et filles bien-aimées</em>, qui, toutes, portent de
bizarres noms, a pour objet d’encourager et de guider une congrégation
de femmes qui, sous la direction de quelques missionnaires,
essayait de se former dans une province Galloise.”</p>

<p>There is really something very amusing in the difficulties of
these scholars over a list of people one of whom bears the very
commonest of English female names at the time. <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> de Rémusat
at least knew the earlier name of Queen Matilda, and can bring it
in where it is not to be found in his authorities. For he makes
<a name="Page_578" id="Page_578"></a><span class="pageno">578</span>
the abbess in the story of Hermann of Tournay (see <abbr title="volume two pare">vol. ii. p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_32">32</a>,
and <a href="#Note_EE">Appendix EE</a>) enlarge on <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“la beauté de la jeune Edithe,”</span>
though in that story she bears no name at all. “Godit” too,
that is “Godgyth” or “Godgifu,” is clear enough; and a little
knowledge of English nomenclature will carry us through most
of the others, even though some of them may be rare or unique.
“Seit” must he “Sigegyth,” a perfectly possible name. “Virgit”
would seem to be “Wergyth,” also quite possible, while “Luverim,”
which the manuscripts write in two or three ways, is surely a wild
miswriting of Leofrune, of a bearer of which name we have heard
something in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume one page">N. C. vol. i. p.</abbr> 352. “Hydit” is the only name on
the list about which there can be any real difficulty; it is clearly
one of the <em>-gyth</em> names, though it is not easy to see what the first
half of the name is. It is perhaps a little odd when Anselm
addresses Robert and his sisterhood as “filii” in the second letter,
but the form is surely a lawful shortening of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“filius et filiæ.”</span>
There is, one would think, a certain pleasing international unity
in this picture of a company of Englishwomen, directed, it would
seem, by a Norman priest, and so lovingly addressed by a Burgundian
archbishop. Anyhow there is no need to doubt of the
sex of Eadgyth and Godgyth, or to carry them off to Wales,
Scotland, Ireland, or anywhere but the land of their own speech.</p>

<p class="p2">Anselm had other nuns and other devout women to write to
and about, besides the bearers of these supposed puzzling names.
There are several letters, as <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 125, to a certain Abbess Eulalia.
In <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 70 he writes (in Henry the First’s time) to Athelis or Adeliza,
Abbess of Wilton (it is again Wi<em>n</em>tonia in Migne’s text), comforting
her during the banishment of William Giffard, bishop-elect of
Winchester (see vol. ii. <a href="#Page_349"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 349</a>). More important is the letter
(<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 51) in which he sends the Archdeacon Stephen to hinder
the abbess and nuns of Romsey from paying the worship of a
saint to some person lately dead (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tunc ex toto prohibeant ut
nullus honor, qui alicui sancto exhiberi debet, exhibeatur ab illis,
aut permittant ab aliquo exhiberi mortuo illi quem quidam volunt
pro sancto haberi”</span>). This reminds one of the story of Abbot
Ulfcytel and the worship of Waltheof (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 598);
but we need not suppose, with the old commentator in Migne, that
the person worshipped was Waltheof himself. For it is added that
<a name="Page_579" id="Page_579"></a><span class="pageno">579</span>
the son of the dead man is to be driven out of the town, and
Waltheof left no son. In <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 84 he writes to Matilda, the first
abbess of the house of the Trinity at Caen (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol iv. p.</abbr> 630),
about her intended resignation of her abbey. On other monastic
affairs there are several letters, as <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 61, 118, about the affairs of
the abbey of Saint Eadmund, whose prior bears the English
name of Ælfhere. He speaks of their tribulations and the patience
with which they bore them; the letters therefore most likely refer
to the difficulties which followed the appointment of Abbot Robert
(see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 359). There are two letters (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 100, 108) addressed to
a monk Ordwine, in the latter of which he is coupled with two
others, Farman&mdash;&#8203;can he be the aged friend of Eadmer?--and
Benjamin, which last name we should hardly have looked for.
The first letter is a very important one; it deals with the subject
of investitures, and distinctly shows that Anselm had no objection
of his own to investiture by the King;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Non ego prohibeo per me a rege dari investituras ecclesiarum,
sed quia audivi apostolicum in magno concilio excommunicare
laicos dantes illas investituras et accipientes, et qui accipientes
sacrabunt, nolo communicare excommunicatis nec fieri excommunicatus.”</p>

<p>This letter contains also a good deal about the relations of
laymen to churches as patrons or “custodes” (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 455, and <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C.
vol. v. p.</abbr> 501). In <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 83, when already Archbishop, Anselm writes
to Eustace, the father of Geoffrey a monk of Bec, at his son’s instance,
rebuking him for a singular kind of bigamy. His wife, the mother of
Geoffrey, had become a nun, and he himself had taken a vow; but
had nevertheless married a second wife. Anselm argues that, whether
he had taken a vow or not, still, though his wife had become a nun,
it is unlawful for him to marry again during her lifetime. Of a
more strictly domestic nature are the letters to his sister Richera or
Richeza, and her husband Burgundius (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 63, 66, 67). Burgundius
is meditating a pilgrimage to Jerusalem; and he exhorts him so to
order his affairs before he goes that his wife may not lose her
estate in case he dies by the way.</p>

<p class="p2">Anselm’s correspondence with royal and princely persons in
various parts is very large. There are many letters to King Henry,
in one of which (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 79) he cannot keep himself from the established
<a name="Page_580" id="Page_580"></a><span class="pageno">580</span>
pun on the name of Henry’s people. He prays, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ut Deus vos et
vestra sic regat et protegat in gloria temporalis regni super
Anglos, quatenus in æterna felicitate regnare faciat inter angelos.”</span></p>

<p>He writes (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 81) a letter of rebuke to his old friend Earl Hugh,
about the captivity of one monk of Clugny, and the irregular burial
of another. He warns the Earl frankly; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Familiariter dico vobis,
sicut homini cujus honorem et utilitatem multum amo, quia si
non feceritis quod dico, inde blasphemabimini; et ego etiam si
non fecero quod ecclesiastica disciplina præcipit inde fieri, a multis
blasphemabor.”</span> To his former enemy Count Robert of Meulan he
writes a letter during his second exile which is given by Eadmer
(<abbr title="Historia novorum">Hist. Nov.</abbr> 82), where the Count is addressed as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“dominus et
amicus;”</span> in another (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 99) he is advanced to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“dominus et amicus
carissimus,”</span> and is addressed as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“vestra dilectio.”</span> The subject of
the letter is the endless dispute between York and Canterbury.
The mention of the younger Thomas as archbishop-elect fixes the
date to about 1108.</p>

<p class="p2">Among foreign kings and princes there is (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 65) a graceful
letter to his native sovereign, Humbert Count and Marquess,
written, it would seem, at the time of his first passing into Italy.
Nearer to his Norman and English dwelling-places, we find him
receiving during his exile a letter from King Philip (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 50) offering
his sympathy and help, and praying for a visit in his dominions,
chiefly for the sake of Anselm’s bodily health;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cæterum quia in loco corporeæ sanitati contrario exsulatis,
rogamus vos quatenus Galliam nostram vestro adventu visitare
dignemini, ibique affectum mentis meæ experiemini, et vestræ
consuletis sanitati. Valete.”</p>

<p>A letter to the same effect, which must belong to Anselm’s second
exile, follows from Philip’s worthier successor, Lewis (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 51).</p>

<p>Both the famous chiefs of the Cenomannian state came in for
a share of Anselm’s correspondence. In <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 11 we have one letter
of Anselm to Hildebert, but it contains no historical information.
There are several (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 53, 160, 161, 162) from Hildebert to
Anselm, all theological, and in which we could have wished that
the Bishop of Le Mans could have brought himself to speak more
civilly of the eastern half of Christendom. More interesting is a
letter (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 98) addressed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Domino et amico, et in Deo dilectissimo</span>
<a name="Page_581" id="Page_581"></a><span class="pageno">581</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eliæ comiti,” full of praise and affection for the noble Count, and
granting him absolution for some fault not described (“Absolutionem
nostram, quam per eundem fratrem, sicut ipse mihi retulit,
a me petitis, et corde, et ore, et scriptura dilectioni vestræ mitto,
et quotidie pro vobis oro”</span>).</p>

<p>To Countess Ida of Boulogne (see <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 374, 384) he writes as an intimate
friend (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 56, 58). In the former of these we hear of her chaplain
Lambert, who was in England in her service. He seems to have
been a canon of some chapter, and to have been in danger of losing
part of the income of his prebend on account of his absence. To
Countess Clemence of Flanders, wife of Count Robert of Jerusalem
and niece of Pope Calixtus, he writes (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 59), praising her and her
husband, because certain abbots in Flanders are admitted without
the Count’s investiture;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Relatum mihi est quosdam abbates in Flandria sic constitutos
ut comes vir vester nullam cis manu sua daret investituram. Quod
sicut non sine ejus prudenti <em>clementia</em> ita non esse æstimo factum
absque vestra <em>clementi</em> prudentia.”</span> The play on the Countess’s
name reminds one of King Robert and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“O constantia martyrum.”</span>
In <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 13 there is a letter to Count Robert, to the same effect as
that to his wife.</p>

<p>But the care of Anselm extended to more distant, at least less
known lands. He has two letters (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 142, 147) to King Murtagh
in Ireland; but they deal only with the reforms needed in
Murtagh’s own island. So, at a later time than ours, he writes (iii.
132) a letter to Alexander King of Scots, in which he mentions
certain monks whom he had sent into Scotland at the request of the
late King Eadgar, of whom he speaks most highly. When in a letter
to a King of Scots we read that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quidem reges, sicut David,
sancte vixerunt,”</span> we are apt to forget that, in Alexander’s
reign, the reference must still be to the King of Israel. Where
such a reference would have been strictly to the merits of a predecessor,
namely, in two letters to King Baldwin of Jerusalem (iv.
10, 36), it is not found; and the exhortations are very general.</p>

<p class="p2">Nor does Anselm forget the Scandinavian lands. He writes
(<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 92) a letter of good advice to Hakon Earl of Orkney, who
had received the earldom of his father Paul after the death
of Magnus of Norway. He writes about the religious ignorance
<a name="Page_582" id="Page_582"></a><span class="pageno">582</span>
of the people, which he hopes will be reformed by the bishop
who had lately been sent to them. As Hakon only received his
earldom in 1105, this letter must belong to the last years of
Anselm’s life. The murder of Saint Magnus by Hakon, followed
by the murderer’s repentant pilgrimage to Jerusalem, did not
happen till after Anselm’s death (see Torfæi Orcades, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 86, where
the date of Magnus’s murder is fixed to 1110). He has two letters
(<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 143, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 90) about the newly-founded archbishopric of Lund in
Denmark. At another end of Christendom he writes to Diacus,
Bishop of Saint James of Compostella. The Spanish Bishop asks
for English help against the Saracens, and he answers that England
is so beset by wars at home that he fears that no help can be
given.</p>

<p>To the Popes Urban and Paschal he naturally writes some very
important letters, some of which have been already referred to.
There is one (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 37) to Urban, in which he sets forth his strong
desire to come to Rome, and alleges the wars which were raging
everywhere as the cause of the King’s unwillingness to let him go.</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quia bellis undique quatimur, hostiles impetus indesinenter et
insidias adversantium metuimus, dominus noster rex extra regnum
me procedere hactenus non permisit, nec adhuc procedere posse
ullatenus assensit…. Sed inter hæc, quo labore, quaque anxietate
gravatus, iter arripere conarer, si omnipotens Deus et in regno
Anglorum bella sedaret, et in regnis et regnorum provinciis, per
quas ad vos est eundum, illam pacem tribueret, quemadmodum
oporteret et expediret iter ipsum explere liceret.”</p>

<p>This letter one would have been inclined to place in 1097; but,
unless we can understand the “regnum Anglorum” as taking in
Wales, the mention of wars would seem to fix it to the time of the
rebellion of Robert of Mowbray in 1095, when the war did indeed
affect Anselm’s movements. In the same letter he makes intercession
for Fulk Bishop of Beauvais, one of the prelates to whom
he had written at the time of his own appointment to the archbishopric
(see <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 11, and above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 576), on account of some matter
which is not explained.</p>

<p>To Paschal he writes a most important letter (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 40) at some
time during the short interval between Paschal’s election and
William’s death; here he sets forth his own case very distinctly;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Videbam in Anglia multa mala quorum ad me pertinebat
<a name="Page_583" id="Page_583"></a><span class="pageno">583</span>
correctio, quæ nec corrigere nec sine peccato meo tolerare poteram.
Exigebat enim a me rex ut voluntatibus suis, quæ contra legem et
voluntatem Dei erant, sub nomine <em>rectitudinis</em> assensum præberem.
Nam sine sua jussione apostolicum nolebat recipi aut appellari in
Anglia, nec ut epistolam ei mitterem aut ab eo missam reciperem,
vel decretis ejus obedirem. Concilium non permisit celebrari in
regno suo ex quo rex factus jam per tredecim annos. Terras
ecclesiæ hominibus suis dabat; in omnibus his et similibus si
consilium petebam, omnes de regno ejus etiam suffraganei mei
episcopi negabant se consilium daturos nisi secundum voluntatem
regis.”</p>

<p>Here we have Anselm’s grievances very clearly set forth, and
without any kind of exaggeration or strong language of any kind.
We may also mark the legal term “rectitudo.” He next goes on
to describe the council of Winchester;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hæc et multa alia, quæ contra voluntatem et legem Dei sunt,
videns, petii licentiam ab eo sedem adeundi apostolicam, ut inde
consilium de anima mea et de officio mihi injuncto acciperem.
Respondit rex me in se peccasse pro sola postulatione hujus licentiæ,
et proposuit mihi ut aut de hac re, sicut de culpa, satisfacerem, et
securum illum redderem ne amplius peterem hanc licentiam,
nec aliquando apostolicum appellarem, aut de terra ejus cito
exirem.”</p>

<p>He then describes the dealings of the King with the estates of
the see after he was gone, and speaks of the dealings of Urban
with the King, in the style in which it was perhaps becoming to
speak to a Pope of the dealings of his predecessor;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex, mox ut de Anglia exivi, taxato simpliciter victu et vestitu
monachorum nostrorum, totum archiepiscopatum invasit et in
proprios usus convertit. Monitus et rogatus a domino papa ut hoc
corrigeret contempsit, et adhuc in hoc perseverat.”</p>

<p>He then asks the Pope that he may not be commanded to return
to England, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“nisi ita ut legem et voluntatem Dei et decreta
apostolica voluntati hominis liceat mihi præferre: et nisi rex mihi
terras ecclesiæ reddiderit, et quidquid de archiepiscopatu propter
hoc quia sedem apostolicam petii, accepit.</span>”</p>

<p>Presently a wholly new set of questions was opened by the
accession of Henry and the second controversy. Anselm’s account,
it will be seen, strictly agrees with the narrative of Eadmer, and
<a name="Page_584" id="Page_584"></a><span class="pageno">584</span>
we may again mark that he does not speak of lay investitures as a
grievance. That is to say, William Rufus had not been to blame,
or at least Anselm had not found out that he was to blame, for
continuing the ancient custom of his kingdom. Henry was to
blame because he claimed to continue that right in the teeth of the
new decrees, and of the new lights which Anselm had learned
from them.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><a name="Note_Z" id="Note_Z"></a>NOTE Z. <abbr title="Volume one page">Vol. i. p.</abbr> 395.</p>

<p class="center sc">Robert Bloet.</p>

<p><span class="sc">There</span> is something startling in the simple way in which the
Chronicler (1093) puts together the appointment of Anselm and
that of Robert Bloet; “And þæt arcebiscoprice on Cantwarbyrig,
þe ær on his agenre hand stód, Anselme betæhte, se wæs ær abbot
on Bǽc, and Rodbeard his cancelere þæt biscoprice on Lincolne.”
Florence translates, with a word or two of explanation inserted;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Insuper Anselmo Beccensi abbati qui tunc <em>in Anglia morabatur</em>,
Dorubernensem archiepiscopatum, et cancellario suo Rotberto, <em>cognomento
Bloet</em>, Lindicolinensem dedit præsulatum.”</span> But this way of
speaking is quite of a piece with the small amount of notice which
the Chronicler seems throughout to give to Anselm and his affairs.
That is, we are used to read the story of Anselm in Eadmer in
the minutest detail, and we are surprised to find his story told
in the Chronicle only on the same scale as the stories of other
people.</p>

<p>We have heard of Robert Bloet before, as one high in the confidence
of both Williams, father and son (see <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 13). As a
bishop, he is one of those persons of whom William of Malmesbury
wrote an account which he afterwards found it expedient to alter.
In his received text (<abbr title="Gestis Pontificum">Gest. Pont.</abbr> 313) he is brought in in a singular
and sneering way. The writer had just recorded the death of Remigius
before he was able to consecrate the minster, and he then gives
this account of his successor;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rem dilatam successor ejus non graviter explevit, utpote qui in
labores alterius delicatus intrasset; Rotberto Bloet homini nomen.
Vixit in episcopatu annis paulo minus <abbr title="30th">xxxᵗᵃ</abbr>, decessitque procul a
<a name="Page_585" id="Page_585"></a><span class="pageno">585</span>
sede apud Wdestoche, cum regio lateri cum alio quodam episcopo adequitaret,
subito fato interceptus. Cetera satis suis hilaris et parum
gravis, negotiorum scientia secularium nulli secundus, ecclesiasticorum
non ita. Ecclesiam cui sedit ornamentis pretiossissimis
decoravit. Defuncti corpus exinteratum, ne tetris nidoribus vitiaret
aerem. Viscera Egnesham, reliqua Lindocolinæ sepulta sunt. Monachos
enim qui apud Stou fuerunt vivens Eglesham [Egnesham]
migraverat.”</p>

<p>Here we have the implied picture of a bishop of the more worldly
sort, and we can see that he was not in good favour with monks.
But no particular fault is brought against him. But in the earlier
version, the text, after the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“homini nomen,”</span> reads, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Qui nihil
unquam pensi fecerit, quominus omnis libidinis et infamis et reus
esset. In cunctam religionem protervus, monachos Stou summoveri
et apud Egnesham locari jussit. Gratis malus et gloriæ antecessoris
invidus, a vicinis monachis sua commoda præverti causabatur.
Quocirca, si monachi Egneshamnenses Dei dono pulchrum incrementum
acceperint, procul illi gratias, quibus eximium se gloriabatur
commodum inferre si vel illos sineret vivere.”</span></p>

<p>There is enough here to show that Robert Bloet was thoroughly
disliked by the monks everywhere on account of his dealings with
their brethren at Stow in removing them to Eynsham. His dislike
to monks is also witnessed by the Chronicler, 1123, in recording
the election of William of Corbeuil to the see of Canterbury (see
<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 236); “Ðis wæs eall ear gedon ðurh se biscop of
Seresbyrig, and þurh se biscop of Lincolne, ær he wære dead, forði
þet næfre ne luueden hi munece regol, ac wæron æfre togænes muneces
and here regol.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, Robert Bloet has not been without his admirers
and defenders both in his own time and since. Henry of Huntingdon,
who was brought up in his court, always speaks of him with
the deepest affection; and in our time he has found a gallant champion
in Mr. Dimock in his preface to the seventh volume of Giraldus,
<abbr title="pages 23 and following">pp. xxiii. et seq.</abbr> Henry, like Florence, has the Chronicle before him
in recording the appointments of Anselm and Robert, and he too
makes (<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 3. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 216) his insertions. With him the passage stands
thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dedit [junior Willelmus] archiepiscopatum Cantuariæ Anselmo
abbati, viro sancto et venerabili. Roberto quoque cognomento Bloet
<a name="Page_586" id="Page_586"></a><span class="pageno">586</span>
cancellario suo, dedit episcopatum Lincoliæ, quo non erat alter forma
venustior, mente serenior, affatu dulcior.”</p>

<p>Further on he records his death in 1123 (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 244), and gives him
a splendid epitaph. He is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pontificum Robertus honor,”</span> and his
special virtues fill two elegiac couplets;</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="i0a">“Hic humilis dives, (res mira,) potens pius, ultor</div>
<div class="i2">Compatiens, mitis cum pateretur erat.</div>
<div class="i0">Noluit esse suis dominus, studuit pater esse,</div>
<div class="i2">Semper in adversis murus et arma suis.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>He speaks of him again in the letter <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“de Contemptu Mundi”</span>
(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 299), where he gives a glowing description of the splendour of
his court, and speaks of him as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ipse quasi pater et deus omnium
æstimatus,”</span> and as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“justitiarius totius Angliæ et ab omnibus summe
formidatus.”</span> He then goes on to quote him as an example, like so
many others, of the uncertainty of earthly prosperity. He tells how
he was troubled before his death by law-suits brought by some
inferior justiciar, and then records his death at Woodstock. He adds,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Fuit autem Robertus præsul mitis et humilis, multos erigens,
nullum deprimens, pater orphanorum, deliciæ suorum.”</span> Further
on (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 305) we learn that Robert Bloet had a son named Simon,
who was born before he was Bishop, but whom he made Dean of
Lincoln while he was very young. Simon’s prosperity and unhappy
end are also among the instances which are to lead to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“contemptus
mundi.”</span> He is thus brought in;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Decanum nostrum Simonem non prætereo, qui filius Roberti
præsulis nostri fuit; quem genuerat dum cancellarius Willelmi magni
regis esset. Qui, ut decebat, regaliter nutritus, et adhuc impubis
decanus noster effectus, in summam regis amicitiam et curiales dignitates
mox provectus est.”</p>

<p>We may be sure that it was the existence of this son which
caused Bishop Robert to be reproached with looseness of life.
Yet Simon may very likely have been born in lawful wedlock,
though it is hardly safe to assume with Mr. Dimock that he certainly
was. But, when Robert had once become an object of monastic
dislike, stories grew as usual; it was found out that his tomb in
Lincoln minster was haunted. So says the so-called Bromton
(X Scriptt. 988), who is copied by Knighton (2364);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Episcopatum Lincolniensem, per mortem sancti Remigii vacantem,
<a name="Page_587" id="Page_587"></a><span class="pageno">587</span>
Roberto cognomento Bloet cancellario suo, viro quidem
libidinoso, dedit, qui prædictam ecclesiæ dedicationem Lincolniensis
postea segniter explevit. Hic demum apud Wodestoke a latere
regis recedens obiit et exenteratus est, cujus viscera apud monasterium
de Eynesham quod ipse fundaverit, cetera apud Lincolniam
sunt humata, ubi satis constabat loci custodes nocturnis umbris
esse agitatos, quousque ille locus missis et eleemosynis piaretur.”</p>

<p>The reputation which Bishop Robert left behind him at Lincoln
we learn from Giraldus and John of Schalby in the seventh volume
of Dimock’s Giraldus. Giraldus himself (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 31) brings him in as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“prudentia et probitate conspicuus.”</span> He records his gifts to his
church, and his doubling the number of its prebends. From a
Lincoln point of view, he highly approves of the translation of the
monks of Stow to Eynsham; but he seems not to like the separation
of Ely from the diocese of Lincoln (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 229),
and he speaks of Robert’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“inconsiderata largitio”</span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“alia sui deliramenta”</span>
in charging his see with the gift of a mantle of sable,
worth a hundred pounds, to the King. John of Schalby (195) copies
Giraldus, but abridges him, and leaves out some of his epithets
both of praise and blame.</p>

<p class="p2">The death of Bishop Robert in 1123 is recorded by several of
our writers, but there is no account so graphic as that in our
own tongue. The King is riding in his deerfold at Woodstock
with the two bishops, Robert of Lincoln and Roger of Salisbury,
on either side of him. The three ride and talk. The Bishop
of Lincoln suddenly sinks, and says to the King, “Lord King,
I die (Laferd kyng, ic swelte).” The King gets down from his
horse, lifts him in his arms, and has him carried into the house,
where he soon dies (“Se king alihte dune of his hors, and alehte
hine betweox his earmes, and let hine beran ham to his inne, and
wearð þa sone dead”). Does this “inne” mean the King’s own
house at Woodstock, or any separate quarters of the Bishop, like the
“hospitium” of Anselm at Gloucester and elsewhere?</p>

<p class="p2">There is something odd in the Bishop’s last words being given
in English. The King knew that tongue, and the Bishop may
very likely have done so; but we can hardly fancy that they spoke
it to one another.
<a name="Page_588" id="Page_588"></a><span class="pageno">588</span></p>

<p>The name “Bloet,” according to <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> de Rémusat (Anselme, 160),
is the same as “blond.”</p>

<p class="center sc">The Mission of Abbot Geronto.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I am</span> not aware that this mission of the Abbot of Dijon has
hitherto found any place in any narrative history of the times of
William Rufus. And I confess that it is not without a certain
misgiving that I bring it in. It is certainly remarkable that our own
writers should with one consent pass by an event of this kind;
but it would be yet more amazing if it were sheer mistake or
invention on the part of the foreign writer who records it. It is
one of those cases in which, without any actual contradiction, it is
very hard to bring a certain statement into its right place. There
is nothing in the story told by Hugh of Flavigny which is really
inconsistent with the narrative of Eadmer; our only difficulty is
how it came that, if these things happened, Eadmer, who could not
fail to have known of them, did not think them worthy of any
place in his very minute narrative. This difficulty we must get
over how we can. Otherwise the evidence of Hugh of Flavigny is
in a certain sense as good as that of Eadmer himself. He stood to
Abbot Geronto in much the same relation in which Eadmer stood
to Anselm. In his narrative, Geronto is sent by the Pope on a
mission to Normandy and England, and Hugh himself, a monk of
Geronto’s monastery, comes with him. For the mere facts therefore
of Geronto’s mission Hugh is as good a witness as Eadmer; but, as
a foreigner on a short visit, he could not be expected to have the
same thorough knowledge of English affairs as Eadmer, or any
other English, or even Norman, writer. There is to us at least
something very strange in his tone towards Anselm, or rather in
the lack of any mention of Anselm at all. He never speaks of him
by name, and the only fact which he records of him is the very
strange one which I have mentioned in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 535, that at some time,
seemingly at the reception of the pallium, Anselm took an oath to
the Pope, with a reservation of his duty to the King. One hardly
sees how far he means to blame Anselm. The person chiefly
<a name="Page_589" id="Page_589"></a><span class="pageno">589</span>
blamed is Cardinal Walter; Anselm comes in, in a strange casual
way, between the King and the Cardinal.</p>

<p>I have given the whole or nearly the whole of Hugh’s story in
the foot-notes to those parts of the text which are founded upon his
account. He goes on a little later in his story (Pertz, <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 495, 496)
to record the death of William Rufus, and to say something more
about English affairs in general. It is plain that his friends in
England found him perfectly ready to believe the wildest tales that
they chose to tell him. At the same time, the tales that they did
tell him are such as could hardly have come into any man’s head to
tell, except in the reign of William Rufus. It is Hugh of Flavigny
who tells us those specially amazing stories to which I have referred
in <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 544 and <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 503. He has also (496) some odd notices of
the dogs of the city of London, which were small, but very fierce, and
which gathered together by night in front of Saint Paul’s church, so
that no one could dare to pass by. He has also a good deal to say
about those natural phænomena of the reign of which we have
heard a good deal from other writers. He tells the story of the
storm which visited the church of Saint Mary-le-bow, with some
further embellishment, that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quadros super muri altitudinem
sitos, supra quos tectum stabilitum erat, usque ad septem milliaria
evolare fecit.”</span> And while two servants of the church
were sleeping in one bed, a beam was driven down between them
into the earth without doing them any harm, except nearly
frightening them to death; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In eadem etiam ecclesia jacebat
quidem ædituus cum alio quodam in lecto uno, et inter medium
eorum, cum jacerent distante inter se spacio, una trabium vento
acta per medium lecti terram intravit, ut vix summitas ejus appareret,
nec læsit jacentes, nisi quod timore pene exanimati sunt.”</span></p>

<p>Hugh’s Chronicle, in two books, reaches from the Christian æra
to the year 1102. He was born at Verdun in 1065. He was a
monk, first at Verdun, then at Flavigny in the diocese of Toul,
then at Dijon, and lastly Abbot of Flavigny. Jarento or Geronto&mdash;&#8203;I
hardly know how to spell his name&mdash;&#8203;was in the close confidence
of Gregory the Seventh and his successors. There is a letter of
Anselm’s (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 87) addressed to Geronto; but it contains nothing
bearing on his mission to England. It is all concerned with the
affairs of certain monks at Dijon and Chartres.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Embassies between William Rufus and Malcolm
in 1093.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> fullest and clearest narrative of the transactions between
William Rufus and Malcolm which led to their rupture at Gloucester
in 1093 comes from the Chronicle, while some particular
points are given at greater length by Florence. In the Chronicle
the story runs thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Ða æfter þisson sende [se] cyng of Scotlande and þære forewarde
gyrnde þe him behaten wæs, and se cing W. him steofnode
to Gloweceastre and him to Scotlande gislas sende, and Eadgar

ne mihte he beon weorðe naðer ne ure cynges spæce ne þæra forewarde
þe him ær behatene wæron, and forði hi þa mid mycclon
unsehte tohwurfon.”</p>

<p>Here we have very clearly an embassy of complaint sent by
Malcolm to William&mdash;&#8203;an invitation or summons, whichever it is to
be called, to the Gemót at Gloucester sent by William to Malcolm
and accompanied by hostages for his safety&mdash;&#8203;a second embassy
from William to Malcolm, with Eadgar at its head, in whose company
Malcolm’s ambassadors went back to Scotland and Malcolm
himself came to England. All this is cut short by Florence, who
however distinctly affirms the going to and fro of some embassies,
while it is from him that we get the date and a fuller account of
what happened at Gloucester. His narrative stands thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex Scottorum Malcolmus, die festivitatis S. Bartholomæi
Apostoli [24 Aug.], regi Willelmo juniori, ut prius per legatos
inter eos statutum fuerat, in civitate Glaworna occurrit, ut, sicut
quidam primatum Angliæ voluerunt, pace redintegrata, stabilis
inter eos amicitia firmaretur; sed impacati ab invicem discesserunt;
nam Malcolmum videre aut cum eo colloqui, præ nimia superbia et
potentia, Willelmum despexit.”</p>

<p><em>Colloqui</em> is the technical word which we so often come across.
The meeting of the two kings would have been a <em>colloquium</em> or
<em>parliament</em>. It is from Florence again that we get all the technical
law. His account goes on thus;
<a name="Page_591" id="Page_591"></a><span class="pageno">591</span></p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Insuper etiam illum [Malcolmum] ut secundum judicium tantum
suorum [Willelmi] baronum, in curia sua rectitudinem ei faceret,
constringere voluit; sed id agere, nisi in regnorum suorum confiniis,
ubi reges Scottorum erant soliti rectitudinem facere regibus Anglorum,
et secundum judicium primatum utriusque regni, nullo
modo Malcolmus voluit.”</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 311) loses the fact of the embassies
and the summons in a cloud of words;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Multis controversiis utrobique habitis, et fluctuante propter
utrorumque animositatem justitia, Malcolmus ultro Gloecestram
venit, æquis duntaxat conditionibus, multus pro pace precator.”</p>

<p>With regard to more modern discussions, I do not know that I
can do more than give the reader the same references which I gave
in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 120. But Mr. Robertson (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 144 note) certainly
has reason when he says that “it does not follow that Malcolm
spoke feudal Latin because Florence wrote it.” One would be glad
to have the actual words in French, English, or, more precious
than all, Irish. (This sets one thinking what languages Malcolm
may have spoken. We know that he understood English, whether
he learned it at the court of Eadward, or afterwards from his wife.
In one or other of those schools he would most likely also pick
up French. Margaret herself may also have learned High Dutch,
and possibly Magyar, from her parents.) But I can make nothing of
Mr. Robertson’s strange comment that “it is singular to mark how
nearly all the English authorities accuse Malcolm of ‘a breach of
faith’ because he resented the conduct of William, whilst they pass
over without notice the glaring ‘breach of faith’ on the part of
their own king.” Who charges Malcolm with any breach of faith,
except William of Malmesbury in the almost casual passage, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr>
250? And what more could he wish the Chronicler and Florence
to say against William Rufus than what they do say? Mr. Robertson’s
criticism is more to the purpose when he attacks the words
of William of Malmesbury, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 311; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nec quicquam obtinuit, nisi
ut in regnum indemnis rediret, dedignante rege dolo capere quem
virtute subegisset.”</span> He remarks that “the safe-conduct and the
hostages detract something from this much vaunted magnanimity,
but Malmesbury would sacrifice a good deal for the sake of a well-turned
period.” It is certainly hard to see what William had
done to Malcolm which could be called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“virtute subegisse;”</span> but
<a name="Page_592" id="Page_592"></a><span class="pageno">592</span>
Mr. Robertson fails to notice that this particular scruple is characteristic
of William Rufus. Careless of his faith in so many other
cases, he is always careful to observe a safe-conduct.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Death of Malcolm.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> last invasion of England by Malcolm was clearly made in
reprisal for the treatment which he had received at Gloucester.
The words of the Peterborough Chronicler are very remarkable.
They seem to describe a war which is acknowledged to be just in
itself, but which is carried on with needless cruelty;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“And se cyng Melcolm ham to Scotlande gewænde. Ac hraðe
<a name="line592_10" id="line592_10"></a>þaes þe he ham com he his fyrde gegaderode.”</p>

<p>Most of the other writers fail to bring out the connexion both of
time and of cause and effect between the scene at Gloucester and
the invasion which led to Malcolm’s death at Alnwick. Perhaps
we may count Matthew Paris, the zealous panegyrist of Malcolm,
as an exception. He has nothing to tell us about Malcolm’s coming
to Gloucester; but, having mentioned William’s sickness there,
which he wrongly places in 1092, he goes on (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 43);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eodem anno pius rex Scotorum Malcolmus, cujus actus in benedictione
vivunt immortales, cum non immerito contra tirannum
Willelmum <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>. regem sibi injuriantem guerram movisset, interceptus
est subito et, positis insidiis, interemptus.”</p>

<p>So in a later passage (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 47) he speaks of Robert of Mowbray
overcoming Malcolm “proditiose.” Moreover several even of the
English writers seem to imply that there was something treacherous
about the way in which Malcolm met his death. The words of the
Chronicler are, “hine þa Rodbeard se eorl of Norðhymbran mid his
mannan unwæres besyrede and ofsloh.” And directly after he describes
the grief of Margaret on hearing “hyre þa leofstan hlaford
and sunu þus <em>beswikene</em>.” William of Malmesbury mentions the
death of Malcolm twice, and in rather different tones. The first
time (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 250) he seems to jumble up together Malcolm’s two invasions,
leaving out all about the meeting at Gloucester. He had said
that through the whole reign of the Conqueror Malcolm <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“incertis
et sæpe fractis fœderibus ævum egit,”</span> and adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<a name="Page_593" id="Page_593"></a><span class="pageno">593</span>
“Filio Willelmi Willelmo regnante, simili modo impetitus, falso
sacramento insequentem abegit. Nec multo post, dum fidei immemor
superbius provinciam inequitaret, a Roberto de Molbreia
comite Northanhimbriæ, cum filio cæsus est.”</p>

<p>In the second place (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 311), after describing the meeting at
Gloucester, he adds; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Idem proxima hyeme, ab hominibus Roberti
comitis Humbrensium, magis fraude quam viribus occubuit.”</span> No
one would think from this that Malcolm had gone back to Scotland,
got together his army, and invaded Northumberland. It
would rather suggest the idea that he was attacked on his
way back from Gloucester. And this comes out more strongly in
the very confused account of Orderic, 701 C. He mixes up
the events of 1091 and 1093. After the first conference by the
Scots’ water, the two kings go quietly together into England; then
we read;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Post aliquod tempus, dum Melcoma rex ad sua vellet remeare,
muneribusque multis honoratus a rege rediret pacifice, prope fines
suos Rodbertus de Molbraio, cum Morello nepote suo et militibus
armatis occurrit, et ex insperato inermem interfecit. Quod audiens
rex Anglorum, regnique optimates, valde contristati sunt, et pro
tam fœda re, tamque crudeli, a Normannis commissa, nimis erubuerunt.
Priscum facinus a modernis iteratum est. Nam sicut
Abner, filius Ner, a Joab et Abisai, de domo David pacifice rediens,
dolose peremptus est, sic Melcoma rex, de curia Guillelmi regis cum
pace remeans, a Molbraianis trucidatus est.”</p>

<p>This is one of those sayings of Orderic by which we are now and
then fairly puzzled. He gets hold of a scriptural or classical parallel,
and seems to be altogether carried away by it. It is hard to see
the likeness between the cases of Malcolm and Abner; but it is
harder to see why the deed is in a marked way attributed to “Normanni,”
who seem to be distinguished from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“rex Anglorum
regnique optimates.”</span> In what sense were Morel and Robert of
Mowbray Norman, in which the King and the great mass of the
“optimates” were not Norman just as much?</p>

<p>Confused as these two last accounts are, they still suggest that
there was something about the way in which Robert and Morel
contrived the death of Malcolm which William Rufus would have
looked on as not quite consistent with the character of a “probus
miles.” The one word “beswikene” in the Chronicle doubtless
<a name="Page_594" id="Page_594"></a><span class="pageno">594</span>
goes for more than any amount of Latin rhetoric, though its force
is a little weakened by its not occurring in the actual narrative of
Malcolm’s death, but in the account of Margaret’s grief at hearing
of it, at which point most of our writers put on more or less of the
tone of hagiology. But the only writer who gives us any details
is Fordun (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 20), in a passage which professes to come from
Turgot, on which see the remarks of Mr. Hinde in his Simeon,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 261. In his story we read how Malcolm,</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cum maximam prædam ex Anglia, more solito, ultra flumen
These, de Clefeland, Richemond, et alibi sæpius adduceret, castrumque
de Aylnwick, sive Murealden, quod idem est, obsideret, obsessosque
sibi rebellantes oppido affligeret, hi, qui inclusi fuerant,
ab omni humano excludebantur auxilio.”</p>

<p>The besieged, having no other chance, take to treachery. One
man offers himself to go on the desperate venture; he makes his
way to the Scottish camp, and asks for the King;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quærentibus causam inquisitionis dixit, se castrum regi traditurum,
et in argumentum fidei claves ejusdem in hasta sua coram
omnibus portavit oblaturus. Quo audito rex, doli nescius, incaute
a tentorio inermis exiliens et minus provide, occurrit proditori;
at ille, quæsita opportunitate, inermem regem armatus transfixit,
et, latibula silvæ vicinæ festinanter ingressus, eorum manus
evasit.”</p>

<p>Then follows the death of the King’s son Eadward;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Turbato igitur exercitu, dolor dolorem accumulat: nam Eadwardus
regis primogenitus a Northumbris lethaliter vulneratur.”</p>

<p>He dies three days later <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“apud Eardwardisle foresta de Jedwood,”</span>
and was buried at Dunfermline <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“juxta patrem.”</span></p>

<p>It is really impossible that this can be a genuine bit of Turgot.
There is nothing anywhere else about a siege of Alnwick, and Mr.
Hinde pertinently raises the question whether there was anything
at Alnwick to besiege. At any rate, it is strange that the defenders
of Alnwick, or anybody else whom Malcolm might come across in
Northumberland, should be called “rebellantes” against him. There
is a very mythical sound about the alleged form of Malcolm’s death.
In the Tapestry (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume three page">N. C. vol. iii. p.</abbr> 240) keys are handed to a
victorious besieger on the point of a spear; but it is from the walls
of the besieged place, and they are received in the like sort. They
surely would not be presented in this way in the King’s own camp.
<a name="Page_595" id="Page_595"></a><span class="pageno">595</span>
And, if Malcolm was killed in this way, how came Eadward to be
mortally wounded? Mr. Hinde adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The ridiculous tale of the person who pierced the king’s eye,
receiving from that exploit the designation of ‘Piercy, quod Anglice
sonat perforare oculum,’ is interpolated in some <abbr title="manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> of Fordun.
This story must necessarily have been invented after the Percy
family became the possessors of Alnwick, and so gave point, if not
probability, to the fiction.”</p>

<p class="p2">I suspect that Malcolm was killed in some ambush or in some
other way unlike open battle. Then sympathy for Margaret called
up&mdash;&#8203;except at Durham and other parts more nearly concerned&mdash;&#8203;sympathy
for Malcolm. Then the Chronicler, in this state of mind,
used the harsh word “beswikene,” and so a tale of actual treachery
grew up. The version in Fordun gives us the story in the form of a
detailed legend; in Orderic the tale itself is still vague; but the
events which went before are so altered as to make any attack on
Malcolm treacherous. In that version, he is going home from the
King’s court in the King’s peace. In the true version, he is invading
England, perhaps on just grounds in his own eyes, certainly
on grounds which made his invasion by no means wonderful. Still
resistance to him was a rightful operation of war, unless there was
any actual treachery in the form which the attack took. That
such there was we have no direct evidence; but there must have
been something or other to account for the tone of so many writers.
Florence is colourless; so is Henry of Huntingdon.</p>

<p class="p2">The Hyde writer, as usual, takes a line of his own. He speaks
(301) of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quidam Robertus Northamhumbrorum comes, vir dives
et potens, qui regem Scotorum Malcolmum, patrem Matildis reginæ,
bellando cum toto pene exercitu interfecit.”</span> It is not unlikely that
the fact that Malcolm was not only the husband of the sainted
Margaret, but also the father of the popular Queen Eadgyth-Matilda,
won for him a measure of sympathy after his death which he had
not enjoyed while he was alive. Indeed we get this relation distinctly
set forth by the Continuator of William of Jumièges (<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 8),
who after recording the life-long imprisonment of Robert of Mowbray,
adds, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dictum est a pluribus, hanc talionem sibi redditam</span>
<a name="Page_596" id="Page_596"></a><span class="pageno">596</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuisse, quia regem Scotiæ, patrem videlicet nobilissimæ Mathildis
postea reginæ Anglorum, dolose peremerat.”</span></p>

<p class="p2">Alnwick, as the place of Malcolm’s death, and of the capture of
another Scottish king in the next century, awakens a certain
amount of real interest beyond the range of mere legend and misapplied
sentiment. The late Mr. Hartshorne wrote with a strange
feeling of devotion towards anything that did profess and call
itself Percy; but he gives us the facts. All that need be known
about Alnwick will be found in his papers in the Archæological
Institute’s second Newcastle volume, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 143. Robert of Veci
appears in Domesday in several shires as far north as Lincoln,
but of course we cannot track him in the unsurveyed parts of
Northumberland. Of the original Percy we have heard something
in various parts in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four pages">N. C. vol. iv. pp.</abbr> 215, 295, 789; <abbr title="volume five page">vol. v. p.</abbr> 773.
The second set of Percies, those of Louvain, got to Alnwick by
a grant from Bishop Antony Beck in 1309 (Hartshorne, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 150,
152). Very little can be made of the Alnwick Chronicle printed
in Mr. Hartshorne’s Appendix. What can we say to a “William
Tisonne” who dies on the English side at Senlac, and who is the
brother of Richard Tisone who founds chapels in the year 1000, as
his father “Gisbright” founded abbeys before him? In this story
the first Norman lord of Alnwick is Ivo of Veci, who is described
as “miles de secretariis,” whatever that may mean, to the Conqueror,
and he gets Alnwick along with the daughter of the slain
William Tisonne. Alnwick may quite possibly have passed to a
Norman lord by marriage with an English heiress, but assuredly
her father was not called William and did not bear an hereditary
surname, and it is much to his credit if, in the teeth of his Earl, he
found his way to the great battle from a point so far north as
Alnwick.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Burial of Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I do</span> not wish to commit myself to any view as to the authorship
of the writings attributed to Turgot. It is sometimes,
as I have more than once remarked, hard to believe that the
<a name="Page_597" id="Page_597"></a><span class="pageno">597</span>
passages which are worked into the text of Fordun, and which
are printed at the end of the Surtees Simeon as Turgot’s writing,
can really come from a contemporary writer. Still, whether
Turgot’s or not, they contain fragments of real information for
which, in the great meagreness of our notices of Scottish matters,
we may well be thankful. In this case, it is from one of these
passages that we learn for certain, what we might for ourselves
have been inclined to guess, that Margaret, so deeply reverenced
in England then and in Scotland in later times, was not popular
in Scotland in her own day. Of her death, as we have seen, we
have several accounts, the fullest and most trustworthy being in
her own Life by Turgot. Again, we have several notices, though
somewhat meagre ones, of the national Scottish movement which
placed Donald on the throne. But it is only from one of these other
bits of Turgot (if it be Turgot) that we could find out that the two
things had anything to do with one another, and that the first
thing which the national party did was to attempt to disturb the
burial of the holy Queen. There is nothing of this in the Life, a
fact which may possibly mark the difference between Turgot writing
hagiography, though I believe truthful hagiography, and the same
Turgot writing ordinary history. In the former character, he does
not invent or pervert; he simply leaves out an unpleasant fact
which in the other and humbler character he records.</p>

<p>The account of Margaret’s burial in the Life (Surtees Simeon,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 254) stands thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Corpus ipsius honorabiliter, ut reginam decebat, involutum, ad
Sanctæ Trinitatis, quam ipsa construxerat, ecclesiam deportavimus,
ibique, sicut ipsa jusserat, contra altare et sanctæ crucis (quod ibidem
erexerat) venerabile signum, sepulturæ tradidimus.”</p>

<p>These words cannot come directly from Turgot himself, who was not
there, but from the priest (see <a href="#Page_27"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27</a>) who told him the story. Again,
Turgot’s readers would most likely understand that by the church
of the Holy Trinity was meant the church of Dunfermline. Otherwise
one might easily read the passage as implying that Margaret
was buried in the same place in which she died, though no name
is given for either. It is from the other account (Fordun, <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 21)
that we learn that the death happened at Edinburgh and the burial
at Dunfermline. Here we get a picture of Donald at the head of
the insurgents or patriots, or whatever we are to call them, entering
<a name="Page_598" id="Page_598"></a><span class="pageno">598</span>
Edinburgh by one gate, while the body of Margaret is carried out
by the other. The story runs thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cum adhuc corpus sanctæ reginæ esset in castro [puellarum]
ubi illius felix anima ad Christum quem semper dilexerat migravit,
Donaldus Rufus vel Bane, frater regis, ejus audita morte, regnum
multorum manu vallatus invasit, et prædictum castrum, ubi regis
justos et legales sciebat heredes, hostiliter obsedit. Sed quia locus
ille natura sui in se valde munitus est, portas solummodo credidit
custodiendas, eo quod introitus aut exitus aliunde non de facili
pateat. Quod intelligentes qui intus erant, docti a Deo, meritis, ut
credimus, sanctæ reginæ, per posticum ex occidentali plaga sanctum
corpus deferebant. Ferunt autem quidam, in toto itinere illo
nebulam subnubilam omnem familiam illam circumdedisse, et ab
omnibus aspectibus hostium miraculose protexisse, ut nec itinerantibus
terra vel mari nihil obfuit, sed ad optatum prospere locum,
ecclesiam scilicet de Dunfermlyn, ubi nunc in Christo requiescit,
sicut ipsa prius jusserat, pervenientes deportarunt.”</p>

<p>In the story of the mist we may clearly see a natural phænomenon
set down as a miracle (see Robertson, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 156). But there
seems no reason for doubting the general outline of the story,
namely, that Margaret was unpopular with the party headed by
Donald, and that they would have gladly disturbed her burial. By
comparing this story with the Life we see how easy it is to leave
out an important part of a tale without bringing in anything that
contradicts it.</p>

<p class="center sc">Eadgyth-Matilda.</p>

<p><span class="sc">That</span> the daughter of Malcolm and Margaret who afterwards
became the wife of Henry the First by the well-known name of
Matilda was baptized by the name of Eadgyth, rests wholly on the
authority of Orderic, who mentions it twice. After recording the
death of Malcolm (702 A), he gives an account of his daughters;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Duas filias, Edith et Mariam, Christianæ, sorori suæ, quæ Rumesiensis
abbatiæ sanctimonialis erat, educandas, sacrisque litteris
imbuendas miserat. Illic diutius inter monachas enutritæ sunt, et
<a name="Page_599" id="Page_599"></a><span class="pageno">599</span>
tam litteratoriam artem quam bonorum observantiam morum edidicerunt,
nubilemque ætatem pertingentes, solatium Dei devotæ
virgines præstolatæ sunt.”</p>

<p>And directly after he calls her <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Mathildis quæ prius dicta est
Edith.”</span> It is a point on which Orderic was likely to be well informed,
as he is always careful and scrupulous in matters of nomenclature,
and often helps us to double names, as we have seen
in the case of Mark Bohemond. And the name Eadgyth is much
more in harmony than Matilda with the other names of Margaret’s
children. Orderic however does not mention the implied change of
name where one might have looked for it, namely where he records
her marriage in 784 A. She is there only <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“generosa virgo nomine
Mathildis;”</span> but in recording her death (843 B), he again says
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Mathildis regina, quæ in baptismate Edit dicta fuit.”</span> <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Francisque
Michel, in his note on Benoît, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 344, refers also to the
Waverley Annals, 1086, for the earlier name; but there is nothing
of the kind there. There is Eadward and Eadgar, but not Eadgyth.
Is one English name held to be as good as another, even when
a confusion of sex is involved?</p>

<p>In Eadmer, <abbr title="Historia novorum">Hist. Nov.</abbr> 56, where he describes the discussions
which went on before the marriage of Henry the First, we get
Eadgyth’s own story. She was brought up by her aunt Christina,
of whom we have already heard (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 695, where
I carelessly spoke of Christina as abbess), in the abbey of Wilton&mdash;&#8203;it
should surely be Romsey. She was not a nun, nor designed to be one,
but she was compelled by her aunt to wear the veil to shelter her from
the violence of the Normans. Whenever her aunt’s back was turned,
she tore it from her head, and trampled upon it, for which the stern
nun gave her niece a good deal of blows and bad language;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cum adolescentula essem, et sub amitæ meæ Christianæ, quam
tu [Anselmus sc.] bene nosti, virga paverem, illa servandi corporis
mei causa contra furentem et cujusque pudori ea tempestate insidiantem
Normannorum libidinem nigrum panniculum capiti meo superponere,
et me illum abjicientem acris verberibus et nimis obscœnis
verborum conviciis sæpe cruciare simul et dehonestare solebat.
Quem pannum in ipsius quidem præsentia gemens ac tremebunda
ferebam, sed mox ut me conspectui ejus subtrahere poteram, arreptum
in humum jacere, pedibus proterere, et ita quo in odio fervebam,
quamvis insipienter, consueveram desævire.”
<a name="Page_600" id="Page_600"></a><span class="pageno">600</span></p>

<p>Then her father comes, sees her with the veil, tears it from her
head, and says that he does not mean her to be a nun, but to be
the wife of Count Alan (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Pater meus cum me, quemadmodum dixi,
velatam forte vidisset, furore succensus, injecta manu velum arripuit,
et dissipans illud, odium Dei imprecatus est ei qui mihi illud
imposuit, contestans se comiti Alano me potius in uxorem quam in
contubernium sanctimonialium prædestinasse”</span>).</p>

<p>Here we are not told how she came under her aunt’s care, nor
what became of her after her father’s death. And there is something
odd in the general reference to the “Normans,” unless
it is meant as part of the outburst of special English feeling
in the later months of the year 1100. Another version, instead
of Normans in general, attributes the danger to a particular
Norman whom we should hardly have looked for. This version
is to be found in a most singular story, to which I have slightly
referred in the text (see <a href="#Page_32"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 32</a>) and also in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 169,
in the Narratio Restaurationis Abbatiæ S. Martini Tornacensis
(D’Achery, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 893). The story is brought in at the same point at
which it is brought in by Eadmer, at the time when Eadgyth&mdash;&#8203;if
that is to be her name&mdash;&#8203;is sought in marriage by King Henry.
The writer, Hermann, Abbot of Saint Martin’s, says that he had
heard the story as a young man from Anselm himself. As
Eadmer reports Eadgyth’s own statement, Hermann reports the
statement of the abbess&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“abbatissa in cujus monasterio puella
illa fuerat nutrita.”</span> If any trust can be put in the uncertified
list of abbesses of Romsey in the Monasticon, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 507, the
head of the sisterhood at that time would seem to have been
an English Æthelflæd. The maiden herself also is without a
name, and her brother is confounded with her father. She
is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“puella quædam, filia David regis Scotiæ.”</span> The Abbess’s
story is that the Scottish King entrusted his daughter to her
care, not to become a nun, but simply for education (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex David
pater ejus mihi eam commendavit, non ut sanctimonialis fieret, sed
ut solummodo in ecclesia nostra propter cautelam cum ceteris <a name="line600_6" id="line600_6"></a>puellis
nostris coætancis suis nutriretur et literis erudiretur”</span>). When
the girl is about twelve years old (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“cum jam adolevisset,”</span> which is
explained afterwards to mean “duodennis”), the Abbess hears that
king William (defined as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“rex Willelmus, domini mei regis Henrici
germanus”</span>) has come to see her (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“propter eam videndam</span>
<a name="Page_601" id="Page_601"></a><span class="pageno">601</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">venisse”</span>). In the case of any decent king such a visit would
surely have been neither scandalous nor wonderful. The King is
at the abbey-gate with his knights, and asks to have it opened.
The Abbess fears that he may conceive some bad purpose towards
the maiden, but hopes that he will respect her if she wears the
monastic veil. She therefore persuades Eadgyth to wear the veil
for the time;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hæc audiens, nimiumque perterrita, ne forte ille, ut juvenis et
rex indomitus, qui omne quod animo sibi occurrisset illico facere
volebat, visa pulcritudine puellæ aliquam ei illicitam violentiam
faceret, qui tam improvisus et insperatus propter eam videndam
advenisset, in secretius cubiculum eam introduxi, rem ei sicut erat
aperui, eaque volente velum unum capiti ejus imposui, quatenus eo
viso rex ab illicito complexu revocaretur.”</p>

<p>The King goes into the cloister, as if to look at the flowers
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quasi propter inspiciendas rosas et alias florentes herbas”</span>). He
sees Eadgyth with the veil, and goes away, showing, according to
the Abbess, that his visit had been on her account only (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“mox ut
eam vidit cum ceteris puellis nostris velum capite gestantem,
claustro exivit et ab ecclesia recessit, aperte ostendens se non nisi
propter eam venisse”</span>). Within a week King David came; seeing his
daughter with the veil on her head, he was very angry; he tore it
from her head, trampled it under-foot, and took his daughter
away.</p>

<p>As the Abbot’s memory clearly failed him on one point, it may
have failed him in others. This is, as far as I know, the only
time in history or legend in which William Rufus is brought into
connexion with the name of any woman. It may well be that
Abbess Æthelflæd&mdash;&#8203;if that was her name&mdash;&#8203;did not know the secrets
of the Red King’s court, and reckoned him among ordinary, instead
of extraordinary, sinners.</p>

<p class="p2">The accounts of Orderic and Hermann assert, and that of Eadmer
seems to imply, that Eadgyth at least, most likely Mary also, was
sent to be brought up by their aunt when they were quite children.
But there is something a little odd in the appearance of Malcolm
both in Eadmer and in Hermann, where he is spoken of as if it were
an every-day thing for a King of Scots to show himself at Romsey.
We may here perhaps help ourselves to a date. The visit of
<a name="Page_602" id="Page_602"></a><span class="pageno">602</span>
Malcolm must surely have been when he was in England in 1093.
Eadgyth then, according to Hermann, was about twelve years old.
Now, it seems from William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 389) that she had
a godfather whom we should hardly have looked for in the person
of Duke Robert. When could Robert have been godfather to a
daughter of Malcolm and Margaret? Surely when he was in Scotland
in the autumn of 1080 (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 671). That was
therefore the time of Eadgyth’s birth; she would then be under
thirteen when her father came into England. (Since this note was
printed, I see that <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Gaston Le Hardy, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 41, takes this date for
granted.)</p>

<p>The fact that Malcolm and Margaret themselves sent their
daughters into England seems to dispose of the account in Fordun
(<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 21; see <a href="#Page_30"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 30</a>), according to which their uncle Eadgar somehow
contrived to bring them to England after the death of their parents.
The only way in which the two versions could be reconciled would
be by supposing that, when Malcolm, according to Hermann, took
Eadgyth away from Romsey, he took her back to Scotland.</p>

<p>In Eadgyth’s own statement in Eadmer, she says that her father
meant her to marry Count Alan. So Orderic (702 A) says;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Alanus Rufus Britannorum comes Mathildem, quæ prius dicta
est Edith, in conjugem sibi a rege Rufo requisivit; sed morte præventus
non obtinuit.”</p>

<p>Mr. Robertson (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 152) makes merry over this passage, and takes
the opportunity to sneer at Orderic. How, he asks, could Alan,
who outlived Eadgyth-Matilda and died in 1119&mdash;she died in
1118&mdash;have been prevented by his own death from marrying her?
He objects also that Alan married the second time (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol.
iv. p.</abbr> 647) in 1093, “before Matilda could have sought refuge in
England.” He adds, “Alan, however, was once a suitor for the
hand of Matilda, but to her own father Malcolm (according to her
own words), not to Rufus,” and goes on to tell about Orderic’s
“gossip,” “infinity of error,” and what not. But though Orderic
has made a slight slip, Mr. Robertson’s own error is much greater.
There can be little doubt that the Alan meant is not the Alan of
Britanny who married first Constance the daughter of the Conqueror
and then Ermengarde of Anjou, but Alan the Black the
second lord of Richmond (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 294, and Mrs. Green,
Princesses, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 25), a much more likely husband for the Scottish
<a name="Page_603" id="Page_603"></a><span class="pageno">603</span>
King to think of for his daughter. Now this Alan died in 1093,
just about the right time. Orderic has put <em>Rufus</em> instead of <em>Niger</em>,
which is about the extent of his offence&mdash;&#8203;perhaps confounding
Alan the Black with his brother Alan Fergeant, the first lord of
Richmond. But Mr. Robertson quite forgot that Malcolm sent his
daughters into England long before 1093. Thierry (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 152) saw
clearly which Alan it was.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 418) has a singular passage, where he
tells us that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Matildis, filia regis Scotorum, a teneris annis inter
sanctimoniales apud Wiltoniam et Rumesium educata, literis quoque
fœmineum pectus exercuit. Unde, ut ignobiles nuptias respueret
plusquam semel a patre oblatas, peplum sacratæ professionis index
gestavit.”</span></p>

<p>But who could look on a marriage with Count Alan as
“ignobilis”?</p>

<p class="center sc">Tynemouth and Bamburgh.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> history of Tynemouth, and of Saint Oswine in relation to
Tynemouth, comes largely from the Life of Saint Oswine in the
Miscellanea Biographica published by the Surtees Society. This is
the work of a monk of Saint Alban’s who went to Tynemouth in
1111. There are also several Saint Alban’s documents printed in
the Monasticon, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 312. There is a large history of Tynemouth by
Mr. W. S. Gibson, from which much may be learned, though the
valuable facts and documents have largely to be dug out of a mass
of irrelevant matter.</p>

<p>According to the Saint Alban’s writer, Eadwine built a wooden
church at Tynemouth, and there his daughter <em>Rosella</em> took the veil.
The name is strange enough, but we may perhaps see a confused
tradition of a <em>British</em> name, when we read that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“locus ubi nunc
cœnobium Tinemuthense est, antiquitus a <em>Saxonibus</em> dicebatur Penbalcrag,
i.e. caput valli in rupe. Nam circa hunc locum finis erat
valli Severiani.”</span> This building must be the same as that which is
referred to in the Life, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 11; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Delatus est ad ostium Tynæ fluminis,
locum videlicet ab incolis regionis ob imminentis rupis securitatem
ab hostibus celebrius frequentatum. Sed ob reverentiam gloriosæ</span>
<a name="Page_604" id="Page_604"></a><span class="pageno">604</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virgini Mariæ inibi exhibitam tenerius amatum, ibique sepultus
est in oratorio ejusdem Virginis, quod constructum erat ad aquilonem
fluminis.”</span> He goes on to tell how Oswald rebuilt the wooden
church of stone, and how the monastery was more than once
destroyed by the Danes. The Saint Alban’s writer (<abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum">Mon. Angl.</abbr>
<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 312) speaks more specially of the Danes. The biographer carries
us at once to the time of Tostig;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Memoria sancti martyris Oswini, obsoleta et penitus deleta,
funditus ab hominum notitia evanuit. Jacuitque per multa annorum
curricula gleba sancti corporis sub abjectiori cespite tumulata
et usque ad tempora Thostii comitis et Ægelwini præsulis Dunelmi,
incuriæ pariter et ignorantiæ neglectu, debita veneratione est fraudata.”</p>

<p>The writer has a curious remark to account for the neglect of
the saint; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Genti prædictæ nunc fideles, nunc infideles principabantur,
et juxta principum instituta, varia divinus cultus in
subjectarum plebium studiis sensit dispendia.”</span> This is doubtless
true of Deira, hardly so of Bernicia, where no heathen
prince reigned, though passing heathens did a good deal of
damage.</p>

<p>He then gives a long account of the invention of the saint’s body,
which came about through the vision of a monk named Eadmund.
Judith, according to the character which she bears elsewhere (see
<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume two page">N. C. vol. ii. p.</abbr> 391), appears as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“devota Deo famula,” “præpotens
et devota femina,” “veneranda comitissa.”</span> Of Tostig we are
told that he succeeded Siward, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“non testamenti beneficio, sed
sancti regis Ædwardi dono regio.”</span> He is described as beginning
the new church which the monks of Saint Alban’s afterwards
finished (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 15); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cujus tamen fundamenti initia, ut dicitur,
comes Thostius jecerat, a fundamentis ædificaverunt.”</span> But his
deposition and death seem to be looked upon as a judgement for
not being present in person at the invention (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quia prædixtus comes
Thostius interesse sanctæ inventioni in ditione sua factæ noluit,
eodem anno culpis suis exigentibus ab Anglorum regno expulsus,”</span>
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>), the exact date of which is given, March 15, 1065. It is
added, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Thostio comite proscripto, hæreditas ejus devoluta est ad
fiscum regium.”</span></p>

<p>Simeon in his History of the Church of Durham, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 4, puts the
acts of Tostig and of Waltheof together under the head of Northumbrian
<a name="Page_605" id="Page_605"></a><span class="pageno">605</span>
earls; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ecclesiam sane sancti Oswini in Tinemuthe,
jamdudum donantibus Northymbriæ comitibus, monachi cum adhuc
essent in Gyrvum possederant, unde etiam ipsius sancti ossa ad se
transferentes in ecclesia sancti Pauli secum non parvo tempore
habuerunt, quæ postmodum ad priorem locum retulerunt.”</span> He
then goes on to record the confirmation by Earl Alberic, who <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“hoc
donum renovavit, ipsamque ecclesiam cum suo presbitero ecclesiæ
sancti Cuthberti perpetuo possidendam adjecit.”</span></p>

<p>It would seem that the fall of Tostig hindered the completion of
his church, and that at the time of Waltheof’s grant it was still
without a roof; for he goes on to say, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quæ cum jam per quindecim
annos velut deserta sine tecto durasset, eam monachi culmine
imposito renovarunt, et per tres annos possederunt.”</span> On receiving
the confirmation of Alberic, a monk with a good Danish name was
sent to put things in better order (Simeon, Gesta Regum, 1121);
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ex capituli totius sententia monachus noster <em>Turchillus</em> illuc
mittitur, qui renovato ecclesiæ ipsius culmine, per multum tempus
habitavit ibidem.”</span></p>

<p>I have referred to the charter of Waltheof and to the entry
in Simeon (Gesta Regum, 1080) in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 666. It is
printed, along with a charter of Bishop William confirming it, dated
April 27, 1085, in the time of Earl Alberic, whose confirmation is recorded,
in the Surtees book called Historiæ Dunelmensis Scriptores
Tres, <abbr title="pages 18, 19">pp. xviii, xix</abbr>. The signatures to both are nearly all English,
with the single exception of two to the charter of Waltheof. These
are Gilbert, the nephew (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 665) of Bishop Walcher,
and an unknown Walter. We meet with several other men that
we know, as Morkere’s father Ligulf and his brother Uhtred, and
Leofwine, written “Leobwinus,” the Dean of Durham. We notice
also “Ernan Biscope sune,” and three Englishmen with the knightly
title “Alwinus miles,” “Wlstanus miles,” and “Kinewlfus miles,”
but I do not understand <a name="line605_8" id="line605_8"></a><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“signum Aldredi comitis.”</span> Earl Ealdred,
the common grandfather of Waltheof and young Morkere, had been
murdered long ago, as the sons of Carl found to their cost. The
story is told again in Simeon, Gesta Regum, 1121.</p>

<p>The next stage in the story is the taking away of Tynemouth
from the church of Durham. It is amusing to contrast the ways in
which this story is told at Durham and at Saint Alban’s. Simeon,
in the chapter just quoted, tells us that Earl Robert made the gift
<a name="Page_606" id="Page_606"></a><span class="pageno">606</span>
to Saint Alban’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“propter inimicitias quæ inter episcopum et ipsum
agitabantur”</span> (<abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> Gesta Regum, 1121). The cause of their ill-will,
a dispute about lands, comes out in the next chapter. Roger of
Wendover (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 39), who is copied by Matthew Paris (<abbr title="Historia Anglorum one">Hist. Ang. i.</abbr> 41,
and <abbr title="Chronica Majora two">Chron. Maj. ii.</abbr> 31), tells us how Earl Robert&mdash;“vir quidem Deo
devotus,” Matthew says&mdash;&#8203;gave Tynemouth to Saint Alban’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“divina
inspiratione tactus.”</span> The Gesta Abbatum (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 57) add that it was
done <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“regis et archiepiscopi Lanfranci benevolentia.”</span> It would
seem that under Durham rule Tynemouth had been simply an impropriate
church, while in the hands of Saint Alban’s it became
a cell. The judgement on Abbot Paul is recorded in the Durham
History, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 4. The Gesta Abbatum, which record much about him,
both good and evil, say nothing about this. The Life of Oswine,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 15, gives a full account of the ceremony of the translation of
Saint Oswine, with the date. Bishop Randolf of Durham was there,
Abbot Richard of Saint Alban’s, and “Abbas <em>Salesberiensis</em> Hugo,”
where we may see (see <abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum three">Mon. Angl. iii.</abbr> 495) the old confusion (see
<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 799) between Salisbury and Selby.</p>

<p>Tynemouth then, at the time when the revolt of Robert of Mowbray
began (see <a href="#Page_47"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 47</a>), was already a monastery and a cell to Saint
Alban’s, though the monks of Durham still held that they had been
wrongfully deprived of it. But it appears from the narrative that,
besides the monastery, there was also a castle. The account in the
Chronicle is, “And þone castel æt Tinemuðan besæt oððet he hine
gewann, and þæs eorles broðer þærinne and ealle þa þe him mid
wæron.” Florence says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex exercitu de tota Anglia congregato,
castellum prædicti comitis Rotberti, ad ostium Tinæ fluminis situm,
per duos menses obsedit; et interim, <em>quadam munitiuncula expugnata</em>,
ferme omnes meliores comitis milites cepit, et in custodia
posuit; dein obsessum castellum expugnavit, et fratrem comitis, et
equites, quos intus inveniebat, custodiæ tradidit.”</span> Florence seems
to me to have confounded the sieges of Tynemouth and of the New
Castle. By the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“castellum ad ostium Tinæ”</span> he would seem to
mean the New Castle, and by his “munitiuncula” he would seem
to mean the Earl’s fortress at Tynemouth. Now what was the
relation between the castle and the monastery? As things now
stand, castle and monastery are one. That is to say, the deserted
church&mdash;&#8203;or more strictly the two deserted churches, monastic and
parochial, once under one roof (see Archæological Journal, <abbr title="volume 37">vol. xxxvii.</abbr>
<a name="Page_607" id="Page_607"></a><span class="pageno">607</span>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 250, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 147, 1880)&mdash;standing on the northern promontory is
now surrounded by military buildings and the great gate-house. I
get my notion of the early arrangements of Tynemouth from several
old plans collected by Mr. Gibson. There is one which seems to be
of the sixteenth century, and, as the names are written in a curious
mixture of English, Latin, and Italian, it struck me that it might
be the work of an officer of those Italian mercenaries who were
employed in the civil wars of Edward the Sixth. This is the only
one which distinctly shows “the Castle,” on the southern promontory,
though all mark that point as taken in within the lines
of defence. It seems to me that the southern promontory must
have been the site of the original castle, and that the name of <em>Castle</em>
has shifted to the great gate-house, which fairly deserves it.</p>

<p class="p2">With regard to the order of the sieges, Orderic, who gives us so
full an account of the siege of Bamburgh, tells us nothing about the
others. I gather from the words of the Chronicle that the New
Castle, which we find in the King’s hands directly after, was the
point which was first taken; “Sona þes þe he þider [to Norðhymbran]
com, he manege and forneah ealle þa betste of þes eorles hirede innan
anan fæstene gewann, and on hæftene gedyde.” Florence, as I have
said, seems to have misunderstood the words of the Chronicler, and
to have confounded Tynemouth and the New Castle. This last would
surely be, as the Chronicle implies, the first point of attack after the
army entered Northumberland in the sense which that word now
bears. Next in the narrative of the Chronicle follows the siege
and capture of Tynemouth, and then the great siege of Bamburgh.
Of this famous fortress I found something to say long ago in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume one page">N. C.
vol. i. p.</abbr> 410, where Bamburgh appears as marking one stage in
the art of fortification. Bæda (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 16) witnesses that the place
took its name <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ex Bebbæ quondam reginæ vocabulo;”</span> so also the
Northumbrian writer copied by Simeon of Durham, 774;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Bebba civitas urbs est munitissima, non admodum magna, sed
quasi duorum vel trium agrorum spatium, habens unum introitum
cavatum, et gradibus miro modo exaltatum. Habet in summitate
montis ecclesiam præpulcre factam, in qua est scrinium speciosum
et pretiosum. In quo involuta pallio jacet dextera manus sancti
Oswaldi regis incorrupta, sicut narrat Beda historiographus hujus
gentis.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608"></a><span class="pageno">608</span>
The reference here is to Bæda, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 6, where he tells the story of
Oswald’s bounty and the prophecy of Aidan, and adds how his hand
and arm, cut off after his death in the battle by Penda, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in urbe
regia quæ a regina quondam vocabulo Bebba cognominatur, loculo
inclusæ argenteo in ecclesia sancti Petri servantur, ac digno a cunctis
honore venerantur.”</span> So again, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 12, where Bamburgh is simply
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“regia civitas.”</span> He goes on to speak of the well; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Est in occidente
et in summitate ipsius civitatis fons miro cavatus opere, dulcis
ad potandum et purissimus ad videndum.”</span> Florence also refers to
the origin of the name; with him it is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Bebbanbyrig, id est, Urbs
Bebbæ reginæ;”</span> and Orderic (704 A) draws a little picture of the
spot; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Munitissimum castrum, quod Babbenburg dicitur, obsederunt.
Et quoniam illa munitio inexpugnabilis erat, quia inaccessibilis
videbatur propter paludes et aquas, et alia quædam
itinerantibus contraria, quibus ambiebatur, rex novam munitionem
ad defensionem provinciæ et coartationem hostium construxit, et
militibus, armis, ac victualibus implevit.”</span> This last fact, the making
of the <span class="title">Malvoisin</span>, is recorded by the Chronicler and Florence, both
of whom give the name. The Chronicler says; “Ac þa þa se cyng
geseah þæt he hine gewinnan ne mihte, þa het he makian ænne
castel toforan Bebbaburh and hine <em>on his spæce</em> Malueisin het, þæt
is on Englisc yfel nehhebur, and hine swiðe mid his mannan gesætte,
and syððan suðweard for.” So Florence; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ante Bebbanbyrig in
quam comes fugerat, castellum firmavit, id que Malveisin nominavit,
et in illo militibus positis, in Suthymbriam rediit.”</span> We may here
note the way in which the Chronicler assumes French as the
language of William Rufus, and also Florence’s somewhat archaic
way of speaking of “Suthymbria,” where the Chronicler says
simply “suðweard.” It is something like his mention of West-Saxonia
in 1091 (see <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 305).</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Malvoisin</span> was clearly such a tower as we often hear of,
temporary and of wood, but still not moveable, as is implied in
Florence’s word “firmavit.” But the name seems afterwards to
have been transferred to moveable towers; see Du Cange in Malveisin,
where he refers to the passage about the siege of Dover
in Roger of Wendover, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 380; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Misso prius ad patrem suum
propter petrariam, quæ ‘Malveisine’ Gallice nuncupatur, qua cum
machinis aliis Franci ante castrum locata muros acriter crebris
ictibus verberabant.”</span> In his account of the siege of Bamburgh
<a name="Page_609" id="Page_609"></a><span class="pageno">609</span>
(<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 46) Roger says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cum castellum inexpugnabile advertit, ante
castellum illud castellum aliud <em>ligneum</em> construxit, quod Malveisin
appellavit, in quo partem exercitus sui relinquens inde recessit.”</span>
Matthew Paris copies this in the Chronica Majora in the
Historia Anglorum, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 48; his words are, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ante castellum illud
aliud sed <em>ligneum</em> construxit, ad præcludendum illis exitum, quod
patria lingua <em>Maleveisine</em> appellavit.”</span> Viollet-le-Duc (Military
Architecture of the Middle Ages, 24, <abbr title="English translation">Eng. trans.</abbr>) seems to imply
that moveable towers were known earlier than this time, but he
seems (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 30) to bring the petraria from the East.</p>

<p>As for the details of the siege, the Chronicler and Florence tell
us nothing till we come to the escape of Robert from Bamburgh.
It is Orderic who gives us the picture of the state of mind of Robert
and his companions, which, if it belongs to any period of the siege,
must belong to the time before the King went southward. We see
the loyal troops busily working at the making of the <span class="title">Malvoisin</span>;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Conscii autem perfidiæ et fautores eorum detegi verentes conticuerunt,
et metu exsangues, quia conatus suos nihil valere perpenderunt,
regiis cohortibus immixti, ejus servitium, cujus exitium
optaverant, prompte aggressi sunt. Interea, dum rex in armis cum
agminibus suis ad bellum promptus constaret, et chiliarchos ac
centuriones, aliosque proceres Albionis, cum subditis sibi plebibus,
operi novæ munitionis indesinenter insistere compelleret, Rodbertus
de propugnaculis suis contrarium sibi opus mœstus conspiciebat, et
complices suos alta voce nominatim compellebat, ac ut jusjurandum
de proditionis societate conservarent, palam commonebat. Rex
autem cum fidelibus suis hæc audiens ridebat, et conscia reatus publicati
mens conscios et participes timore et verecundia torquebat.”</p>

<p>Then the King goes away; in Orderic’s phrase, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“rege ad
sua prospere remeante, et de moderamine regni cum suis amicis
solerter tractante,”</span> a rather odd description of the war in Wales.
Now comes Robert’s escape from Bamburgh. Orderic, who seems
to have no clear idea of any place except Bamburgh, merely says
that Robert, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“longæ obsidionis tædio nauseatus, noctu exilivit, et
de castro in castrum migrare volens in manus inimicorum incidit.”</span>
The Chronicle is fuller; “Ða sona æfter þam þe se cyng wæs suð
afaren feorde se eorl anre nihte ut of Bebbaburh towardes Tinemuðan,
ac þa þe innan þam niwun castele wæron his gewær wurdon,
and him æfter foran and onfuhton and hine gewundedon, and syððan
<a name="Page_610" id="Page_610"></a><span class="pageno">610</span>
gelæhton, and þa þe mid him wæron sume ofslogan sume lifes gefengon.”
But it is from Florence that we get the detailed account.
His story runs thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Post cujus discessum, comiti Rotberto vigiles Novi Castelli
promisere in id se permissuros illum intrare, si veniret occulte.
Ille autem lætus effectus, quadam nocte cum <abbr title="30">xxx.</abbr> militibus ut id
perageret exivit. Quo cognito, equites qui castellum custodiebant
illum insequentes, ejus exitum custodibus Novi Castelli per nuntios
intimaverunt. Quod ille nesciens, die dominica tentavit peragere
cœpta, sed nequivit, deprehensus enim erat. Eapropter ad monasterium
S. Oswini regis et martyris fugit, ubi sexto die obsessionis
suæ graviter in crure est vulneratus dum suis adversariis repugnaret,
quorum multi perempti, multi sunt vulnerati, de suis quoque nonnulli
vulnerati, omnes sunt capti; ille vero in ecclesiam fugit, de
qua extractus, in custodia est positus.”</p>

<p>Here now comes the obvious difficulty as to the way in which
the Earl could have got into the monastery at Tynemouth after the
castle had been taken. The Chronicler indeed does not necessarily
imply that he got into Tynemouth at all. The fight which he
describes might have happened somewhere else and not at Tynemouth.
And if any one chooses to move the site of Robert’s resistance
and capture from Tynemouth to some unknown spot, there
is only the statement of Florence against him. That Robert was
taken, and taken after a stout resistance, is plain.</p>

<p>With Robert’s capture, Orderic ends his story, as far as military
operations are concerned. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Captus a satellitibus regis, Rodbertus
finem belli fecit.”</span> In a very general way this is not untrue; it was
the capture of Robert which brought about the end of the war.
But it is odd that he should have left out the striking story of the
captive Earl being brought under frightful threats before the castle
which his wife was defending. This stands out clearly in the
Chronicle; “Ða þa se cyng ongean com, þa het he niman þone eorl
Rotbeard of Norðymbram, and to Bæbbaburh lædan, and ægðer
eage ut adon, buton þa þe þærinne wæron þone castel agyfan
woldan. Hine heoldan his wif and Moreal, se wæs stiward and
eac his mæg. Ðurh þis wearð se cartel þa agyfen.” Florence
translates this.</p>

<p class="p2">Lastly comes the great difference of all as to Earl Robert’s last
<a name="Page_611" id="Page_611"></a><span class="pageno">611</span>
days. The Chronicler and Florence merely record his imprisonment
at Windsor, without saying how long it lasted. Florence says
only, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Comes forti custodiæ mancipandus ad Windlesoram est
ductus,”</span> followed by the passage about Morel quoted in <a href="#Page_55"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 55</a>. He
says nothing about the many accusations brought by Morel, or
about the special summons of all the tenants-in-chief to the trial,
of which the Chronicler speaks (see <a href="#Page_56"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 56</a>). The Chronicler, after
recording them, says; “And þone eorl Rotbert hét se cyng to
Windlesoran lædan, and þær innan þam castele healdan.” This is
consistent with any later destiny, with release and monastic profession
or with lifelong imprisonment. This last is asserted by
several authorities. Thus Orderic (704 A) says; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rodbertus….
fere triginta annis in vinculis vixit, ibique scelerum suorum pœnas
luens consenuit.”</span> He then sets forth the sad state of his wife;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Mathildis uxor ejus, quæ cum eo vix unquam læta fuerat, quia in
articulo perturbationis desponsata fuerat, et inter bellicas clades
tribus tantum mensibus cum tremore viri thoro incubuerat, maritali
consolatione cito caruit, multisque mœroribus afflicta diu gemuit.”</span>
The Continuator of William of Jumièges (<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 8), who has nothing
to say about Matilda, equally bears witness to Robert’s lifelong imprisonment;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Captus a militibus Willelmi regis, ipsoque jubente
in ipsis vinculis diutius perseverans; regnante jam Henrico rege,
tandem in ipso ergastulo deficiens mortuus est.”</span> So William of
Malmesbury, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 319; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Captus et æternis vinculis irretitus est.”</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, there clearly was a story according to which
Robert was released some time or other, and died a monk at Saint
Alban’s. It is somewhat remarkable that there is no mention of
this in any of the chief writings of Matthew Paris, neither in the
Historia Major nor the Historia Anglorum, nor the Lives of the
Abbots. But we find the story implied in the extract from his
<a name="line611_9" id="line611_9"></a>Additamenta in the Monasticon, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 312; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ibidem [at Tynemouth]
monachos congregavit de domo sancti Albani, tanquam ab electissima
domo inter omnia cœnobia Angliæ, ubi etiam se vovit
monasticum habitum suscepturum, et sepulturam in loco memorato.
Quæ omnia, Deo sibi propitio, feliciter consummavit.”</span> So
in the Abbreviatio Chronicorum (<abbr title="Historia Anglorum">Hist. Angl.</abbr> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 175), a marginal
note is added to the name of Earl Robert; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sepultus est
apud sanctum Albanum.”</span> But, oddly enough, the most distinct
statement that he became a monk comes, not from any Saint Alban’s
<a name="Page_612" id="Page_612"></a><span class="pageno">612</span>
writer, but from one manuscript of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De Regibus Saxonum
Libellus”</span> at the end of the Surtees Simeon, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 214. King Henry
keeps Robert of Mowbray some while in prison; then <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“rogatu
baronum suorum eundem resolvens, concessit illi mutare vitam habitumque
sæcularem. Qui ingressus monasterium Sancti Albani sub
professione monastica ibidem vitam finivit.”</span></p>

<p>The story about Matilda’s second marriage and divorce comes
from Orderic. His story runs thus; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Vir ejus, ut dictum est, in
carcere vivebat, nec ipsa, eo vivente, secundum legem Dei alteri
nubere legitime valebat. Tandem, permissu Paschalis papæ, cui
res a curiosis enucleata patuit, post multos dies Nigellus de
Albineio ipsam uxorem accepit, et pro favore nobilium parentum
ejus, aliquamdiu honorifice tenuit. Verum, defuncto Gisleberto
de Aquila fratre ejus, vafer occasionem divortii exquisivit, eamque,
quia consanguinei sui conjux fuerat, repudiavit, et Gundream, sororem
Hugonis de Gornaco, uxorem duxit.”</span> If all this happened
at all, it must have happened between 1099 and 1118, the years
which mark the reign of Paschal.</p>

<p>Matilda of Laigle could not well have been the sister of William
the Chaplain to whom Bishop Herbert Losinga writes his third
letter (<abbr title="Epistle">Ep.</abbr> Herberti, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 5). He there says; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De matrimonio sororis
vestræ non aliud respondeo vobis, quam id quod præsens ex ore
meo audivistis, suo videlicet ut vivente viro, secundum evangelium
et secundum sanctorum canonum usum, alii viro nubere non potest.”</span>
But the person spoken of could hardly have been thinking
of such a marriage, unless she had some special excuse, like this of
Matilda.</p>

<p>The second wife of Nigel appears both as “Gundrea” and as “Gundreda.”
There is a great deal about her husband Nigel and her son
Robert, the founder of Byland Abbey, in the Monasticon, <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 346&ndash;351.
The marriage of Nigel and Gundreda took place after Tinchebrai,
and as King Henry gave Nigel the castle of Mowbray, and much
else in Normandy and England which had belonged to Earl Robert,
their son Roger called himself Roger of Mowbray. Such a description
was likely to lead to confusion, and it may have led some to fancy
that later bearers of the name of Mowbray had something to do
with the famous Bishop and Earl of our story. The artificial Percy
is indeed connected with the real one by grandmothers; but the
artificial Mowbray was purely artificial. This Roger of Mowbray
<a name="Page_613" id="Page_613"></a><span class="pageno">613</span>
appears also in the Continuator of William of Jumièges, <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 8, who
tells us that Nigel himself became a monk at Bec.</p>

<p class="p2">As Walknol has been casually mentioned in the text (<a href="#Page_47"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 47</a>)
there may be some interest in a document in the Cartulary of
Newminster published by the Surtees Society, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 178. The date
must be after 1137, the date of the foundation of Newminster.
The number of English names, and specially the two bearers of
scriptural names who are sons of English-named fathers, illustrate
points of which I have often had to speak;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De terra de Walknol in castro. Johannes filius Edwyni fabri,

<p class="center sc">The Conquest of Glamorgan.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I gave</span> a note to the conquest of Glamorgan in the Appendix to
<abbr title="volume five">vol. v.</abbr> of the Norman Conquest, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 820. I look, as I did then,
upon the account in what I find it convenient to call the later
Brut as thoroughly legendary in its details, though I am perhaps
inclined to put rather more faith in the general story than I was
then. And I am not so much inclined as I was then to draw the
same wide distinction as Mr. Floyd draws between the expeditions
led by the King himself and those which partook more or less of the
character of private adventure. There was doubtless a difference,
when it was King William who called the whole force of England
to his standard, and when it was only either Earl Hugh or Robert
Fitz-hamon who set out on an expedition on his own account. But
<a name="Page_614" id="Page_614"></a><span class="pageno">614</span>
both processes were parts of the same general undertaking. Whatever
individual lords conquered, they conquered with the King’s approval,
to be held by them as his vassals and subjects. He himself stepped
in only on great occasions, when the Welsh seemed to be getting
too strong for the local lords. The same general work must have
been going on all over the country. The only strange thing is that
the conquest of Glamorgan, of whose general results there can be
no doubt, and of which we have so very full a legendary account, is
left out altogether in every really trustworthy history.</p>

<p>Jestin ap Gwrgan must be accepted as a real man, on the
strength of his real sons and grandsons (for his sons see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C.
vol. v. p.</abbr> 821); but that is all that can be said of him. We can
hardly carry our faith so far as Mr. John Williams ab Ithel, the
Editor of the Brut in the Chronicles and Memorials, who asks
us (<abbr title="twenty-three">xxiii</abbr>) to “consider the great age of the prince of Glamorgan
when he died. He is said to have married his first wife
<span class="muchsmaller">A.D.</span> 994”&mdash;&#8203;it is perhaps prudent to mention the æra&mdash;“and to
have died at the age of 111, according to others 129.” We Saxons
do not venture to believe in the kindred tales of our own Harold
and Gyrth. But we learn from Mr. Williams himself, at the very
beginning of his Preface, that “the voice of Tradition would not
lead us to suppose that the ancient Britons paid any very particular
attention to the study of chronology previous to the era of Prydain,
son of Aedd the Great, which is variously dated from the year 1780
to 480 before the nativity of Christ.” If centuries went for so little
in the days of Prydain, it is not wonderful that decades did not
go for much in the days of Jestin. Nor are we surprised to find
that Mr. Williams knew the exact number of the descendants of
Jestin, who were, like those of Attila, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pene populus.”</span> All that we
can say of Jestin’s story, in relation to Robert Fitz-hamon and his
companions, is that there is no trustworthy evidence either for or
against the story of his invitation to the Norman knights, but that
the tale has a legendary sound, and that the date is in any case
wrong. If we should be inclined, according to one or two indications
(see <a href="#Page_84"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 84</a>), to place the conquest of Glamorgan several
years earlier, perhaps even before the death of the Conqueror, we
are only carried away yet further from the perfectly certain date of
the death of Rhys ap Tewdwr. All that we can say is that the
general story may be true, but that the list of settlers given in the
<a name="Page_615" id="Page_615"></a><span class="pageno">615</span>
later Brut (72 to 75) is largely due to family vanity. The Stradling
family, for instance, had nothing to do with the original conquest.</p>

<p>The best account of the whole matter is to be found in Mr.
Clark’s first paper on “The Land of Morgan,” in the Archæological
Journal, <abbr title="thirty-four">xxxiv.</abbr> 11. I cannot however admit with him (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 18) that
“it seems probable that to the early Vikings, and not to the later
settlements of Flemings or English, is due the Teutonic element which
prevails in the topography of lower Pembroke and Gower.” I am
quite ready (see <a href="#Page_95"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 95</a>) to admit a certain Scandinavian element;
but the Flemish settlement in Pembrokeshire is undoubtedly
historical (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 855), while we have fair legendary
evidence for making the settlement in Gower West-Saxon (see <a href="#Page_103"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 103</a>).
The name of <em>Worm’s Head</em> given to the great promontory of Gower,
in marked distinction to the Scandinavian <em>Orm’s Head</em> in North
Wales, goes a long way to show that the Teutonic settlers in Gower
were either Flemish or Saxon, and not Scandinavian.</p>

<p class="center sc">Godwine of Winchester and his son Robert.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I gave</span> a short note to the history of Robert son of Godwine in
<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 819. On going again more minutely through the story,
I am even more struck than before by the singular way in which
different notices of Robert and Godwine hang together. It is one
of the best cases that I know of the argument from undesigned
coincidences. Besides the interest of the story in itself, it teaches
us, like many other stories, how, if we work with a proper caution,
we may dig truth out of quarters where we should hardly have
looked for it, and it may specially suggest matter for thought as
to the value of those pieces of Scottish history which one hardly
knows whether to call the writings of Turgot or Fordun, or of
any one else. I suspect that, if we simply read the story of Godwine
and Robert as it stands in Fordun, we should be inclined to
cast it aside altogether. The story undoubtedly has a legendary
air, and the details of the single combat are likely enough to have
received some legendary colouring even at the time. Some might
<a name="Page_616" id="Page_616"></a><span class="pageno">616</span>
even be a little startled at the appearance of Englishmen of knightly
rank at the court of William Rufus. But we see from Domesday
on the one hand, and from William of Malmesbury on the other,
that Godwine and Robert were real men, and we see that the
part which they play in Fordun’s story is exactly in accordance
with their real position.</p>

<p>I have mentioned elsewhere (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 571; <abbr title="volume five page">vol. v. p.</abbr>
819) that there was a Godwine holding lands in Hertfordshire
of the Ætheling Eadgar. We also have in two places in William
of Malmesbury (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 251; <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 384) notices of “Robertus Anglus,”
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Robertus filius Godwini miles audacissimus,”</span> who goes to the
crusade with the Ætheling, and who does the exploits which I
have spoken of in <a href="#Page_122"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 122</a>. Now if circumstantial evidence is
ever good for anything, one can hardly doubt that the Godwine
of Domesday is the same as the Godwine of William of Malmesbury
and as the Godwine of Fordun, and that the Robert son of
Godwine in Fordun is the same as the Robert son of Godwine in
William of Malmesbury. The three accounts are wholly independent,
but all bring Godwine and Robert into connexion with
Eadgar. It is almost inconceivable that Fordun’s story should
be mere invention, when it makes men of whom so little is
known act exactly in character with the little that is known of
them.</p>

<p>In the account in Fordun (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 22, Surtees Simeon 263), Ordgar,
“Orgarus,” is described in the one text as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“miles degener Anglicus,”</span>
in the other as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“miles de genere Anglico,”</span> which is clearly
the better reading.</p>

<p>The name of Ordgar appears only twice in Domesday. In
Oxfordshire, 161, Ordgar, a king’s thegn, holds two hides of the
worth of forty shillings. He had two slaves on his domain, and
half a carucate was held by two villains or churls. We then read,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Godwinus libere tenuit.”</span> This is pretty sure to be our Ordgar,
and it may very well be our Godwine, though we can say nothing
for certain about so common a name. If they are the same, here is
great likelihood, though no proof, that Godwine may have had
other ground for willingness to fight Ordgar, besides his loyalty
to the Ætheling. Ordgar, on the other hand, appears in Somerset,
93, as holding a hide which had passed to Robert of Courcelles,
and which, with a good deal more, was held by Anschitil. Ordgar
<a name="Page_617" id="Page_617"></a><span class="pageno">617</span>
was not the only Englishman who, among the endless forfeitures
and grants&mdash;&#8203;to say nothing of ordinary sales, bequests, and exchanges,
which went on <abbr title="Tempore Regis Willelmi">T. R. W.</abbr> as well as <abbr title="Tempore Regis Edwardi">T. R. E.</abbr>&mdash;&#8203;lost in one
part of England and gained in another.</p>

<p>In Fordun’s story Eadgar is described as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“clito Eadgarus, <abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>
genere gloriosus, nam sic ipsum nominabant.” “De genere gloriosus,”</span>
it will be marked, is a more literal translation of “Clito”
than it is of “Ætheling.” William is inclined to hearken to
Ordgar, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quia Eadgarus de regia stirpe fuerat progenitus, et
regno, jure Anglico, proximus.”</span> We then read, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“nec incerta de
Eadgaro jam poterat esse sententia, si crimen impositum probari
potuisset.”</span> Eadgar is in great trouble for fear of not finding a
champion, when Godwine steps forward; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Miles de Wintonia,
Anglicus natione, genere non ignobilis, nomine Godwinus, veteris
parentelæ ipsius non immemor, opem se præstiturum in hac re tam
difficili compromisit.”</span></p>

<p>The two knights now go forth, as I have described in the text,
and we have a significant comment on the lack of English patriotism
shown by Ordgar;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hinc etiam calumniatorem cum justa animadversione increpat,
qui Anglicus genere existens naturæ videretur impugnator, quem
enim ut dominum venerari debuerat, utpote de jure generis existens
cui se et omnia sua debuisset.”</p>

<p>Then come the details of the combat. We hear no more of
Godwine after his victory and reward, which last is thus told;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Superati hostis terras et possessiones hereditario jure rex ei
concederet possidendas.” “Hereditario jure”</span> most likely simply
means, as usual, that the land was to go on to Godwine’s heirs.
It need not refer to the probable fact that part at least of Ordgar’s
lands had once belonged to Godwine.</p>

<p>Robert first appears in Fordun, <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 25, on the march to Scotland
(see <a href="#Page_119"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 119</a>). He is introduced as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quidam miles, Anglicus genere,
Robertus nomine, filius antedicti Godwini, paternæ probitatis imitator
et hæres.”</span> Then come his exploits and adventures in Britain,
as I have told them in the text. Afterwards must come his
crusading exploits as described by William of Malmesbury. In
the earlier of his two accounts (see <a href="#Page_122"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 122</a>) one might almost have
thought that King Baldwin had no companion except Robert.
The second passage, which gives them four other companions, has
<a name="Page_618" id="Page_618"></a><span class="pageno">618</span>
therefore the force of a correction; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex … quinque militibus
comitatus, in montana rependo, insidiantes elusit. Militum fuit
unus Robertus Anglus, ut superius dixi; cæteros notitiæ nostræ
fama tam longinqua occubuit. Ille cum tribus comprehensus
est; unus evasit cum rege.”</span> Another point which is worth notice
is that the period of the crusade at which Robert is brought in
exactly agrees with the story of his doings in Scotland and Northumberland.
A man who had difficulties with Flambard after he
became bishop in 1099 could not have been with the first crusaders
at Antioch and Jerusalem; he might have been quite in time to
help Baldwin at Rama.</p>

<p class="p2">It would be worth the while of some Hertfordshire antiquary
to see whether anything can be made out as to the descent of
the lands held by Godwine, or as to any descendants of him and
Robert. But I saw a little time back a newly published history of
that county, which was eloquent about the grandmothers of various
obscure persons of our own time, but which had not a word to say
about the champion of Eadgar or the comrade of Baldwin.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Expedition of Magnus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> expedition of Magnus, which, by leading him to the shores
of Anglesey, had a not unimportant bearing on English affairs,
is not spoken of at any great length by our own writers. The
Chronicler does not name the Norwegian king; but he does not
fail to mention the death of Earl Hugh of Shrewsbury, and, what
was practically its most important result, the succession of his
brother Robert. His words are; “And Hugo eorl wearð ofslagen
innan Anglesege fram ut wikingan and his broðer Rodbert wearð
his yrfenuma, swa swa he hit æt þam cynge ofeode.” Florence
is fuller;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eo tempore rex Norreganorum Magnus, filius regis Olavi, filii
regis Haroldi Harvagri, Orcadas et Mevanias insulas cum suo
adjecisset imperio, paucis navibus advectus illuc venit. At cum
ad terram rates appellere vellet comes Hugo de Scrobbesbyria, multis
<a name="Page_619" id="Page_619"></a><span class="pageno">619</span>
armatis militibus in ipsa maris ripa illi occurrit, et, ut fertur, mox
ab ipso rege sagitta percussus … interiit.”</p>

<p>Florence, it will be seen, here makes the same confusion between
the names <em>Hardrada</em> and <em>Harfagra</em> which he made in 1066, and
which so many others made beside him. To the account in William
of Malmesbury, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 329, I have referred in <a href="#Page_134"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 134</a>. He alone it
is who mentions the presence of the younger Harold in the fleet
of Magnus. His words, which I quoted in <a href="#Page_124"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 124</a>, seem to come
from the same source as the account in Florence; but he gives the
story a different turn by distinctly making Magnus design an attack
on England;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Jam Angliam per Anglesiam obstinatus petebat; sed occurrerunt
ei comites, Hugo Cestrensis et Hugo Scrobesbiriensis; et
antequam continentem ingrederetur, armis eum expulerunt. Cecidit
ibi Hugo Scrobesbiriensis, eminus ferreo hastili perfossus.”</p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon would seem to translate the Chronicle;
but he makes a confusion as to the persons by whom Earl Hugh
was slain; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hugo consul Salopscyre occisus est ab Hibernensibus.
Cui successit Robertus de Belem frater ejus.”</span></p>

<p>If we could suppose that the Archdeacon of Huntingdon had
paid so much attention to British affairs, we might fancy that
he confounded the fleet of Magnus with the wikings from Ireland
whom Cadwgan and Gruffydd hired a little time before. See <a href="#Page_128">p.
128</a>.</p>

<p>The Welsh writers naturally tell the tale as part of their own
history. The Earls have come into Anglesey; then comes Magnus.
There are two different accounts in two manuscripts of the Annales
Cambriæ; that which the editor follows in the text runs thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Francis in insula morantibus, Magnus rex Germaniæ cum
exercitu venit in insulam volens. Sed ei nolenti Franci ei occurrentes
se invicem sagittis salutaverunt, hi de terra, illi de mari,
alter comes sagitta in facie percussus occubuit. Quo facto, Magnus
abivit.”</p>

<p>The other manuscript reads;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Francis in insula morantibus, Magnus rex Germaniæ ad insulam
Mon venit et prœlium cum consulibus commisit; sed alter
consulum vulneratus in facie cecidit; alter vero cum majoribus
insulam dereliquit. Postea vero Magnus rex insulam Mon repente
reliquit.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620"></a><span class="pageno">620</span>
The Brut says;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The French entered the island, and killed some of the men
of the island. And whilst they tarried there, Magnus, King of
Germany, came, accompanied by some of his ships, as far as Mona,
hoping to be enabled to take possession of the countries of the
Britons. And when King Magnus had heard of the frequent
designs of the French to devastate the whole country, and to
reduce it to nothing, he hastened to attack them. And as they
were mutually shooting, the one party from the sea, and the other
party from the land, Earl Hugh was wounded in the face, by the
hand of the King himself. And then King Magnus, with sudden
determination, left the borders of the country.”</p>

<p>It will be seen that both versions of the Annals call Magnus
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“rex Germaniæ.”</span> In the text of the Brut he is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Magnus brenhin
Germania.”</span> Another manuscript, worse informed as to his name,
better informed as to his kingdom, calls him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Maurus brenhin
Norwei.”</span> This odd description of a Norwegian king as king of
Germany has been met with before in the Brut, 1056; but it
is not found in the Annals for that year. But it must have been
by a kindred flight that the annalist in 1066 called Harold Hardrada
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“rex Gothorum.”</span></p>

<p class="p2">Our fuller accounts of the course of Magnus come from Orderic,
from the Manx Chronicle, and from the Saga of Magnus Barefoot
(Johnstone, 231; Laing, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 129). Orderic, as we have seen, looks
upon the expedition as being directly designed against Ireland.
The Norwegian writer mentions Ireland only quite incidentally.
Magnus plunders in Ireland, as everywhere else, on his way
to Man, but the object of the expedition is clearly marked
as being Man and the other islands which were so closely
connected with it, a connexion which is also most strongly set forth
in the pompous words of Orderic (767 D). We can have little
doubt in accepting the Manx writer’s version of the history of his
own island, rather than that of the Norwegian writer, to whom the
internal affairs of the island were of no great interest, or the wild
statement of Orderic (see <a href="#Page_141"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 141</a>) that Man was at this moment
a desert island. On the other hand, the Saga is the best authority
for the actual voyage of Magnus, though it is the Manx writer
who preserves the fact or legend of the irreverent dealings of
<a name="Page_621" id="Page_621"></a><span class="pageno">621</span>
Magnus towards his sainted kinsman. As to what happened in
Anglesey, I have already quoted the accounts of the English and
Welsh writers, and the Manx chronicler does not go into any
greater detail;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ad Moiniam insulam Walliæ navigavit, et duos Hugones
comites invenit in ea; unum occidit, alterum fugavit, et insulam
sibi subjugavit. Wallenses vero multa munera ei præbuerunt, et
valedicens eis ad Manniam remeavit.”</p>

<p>The detailed accounts of the death of Earl Hugh come from the
Saga and from Orderic. Orderic, it must be remembered, is
writing on a subject of special interest to him, on account of his
close connexion from childhood with the house of Montgomery.
On the other hand, as we have seen (see <a href="#Page_143"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 143</a>), he does not well
understand the geography, and seems to fancy that Dwyganwy was
in Anglesey. But it will be at once seen that he conceives the
death of Earl Hugh in a quite different way from the author of
the Saga. In Orderic’s story, though there is a great deal of
preparation for fighting, there is no actual fighting at all, except
the one shot sent from the bow of the Norwegian King. His
version stands thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quadam vero die, dum supra littus indigenæ turbati discurrerent,
seque contra Nordicos, quos in navibus suis sævire contra
Anglos videbant, præpararent, Hugo comes, equum calcaribus
urgens, cœtus suos congregabat, et contra hostes, ne sparsim divisi
invaderentur, principali rigore coercebat. Interea barbarus Nordwigena,
ut comitem agiliter equitantem prospexit, instigante diabolo
stridulum missile subito direxit, egregiumque comitem, proh
dolor! percussit. Qui protinus corruit, et in fluctibus maris jam
æstuantis exspiravit. Unde dolor ingens exortus est.”</p>

<p>This really seems hardly possible, and the Welsh account, as
well as the Norwegian, distinctly records fighting and shooting
of arrows on both sides. The Saga gives us the details, both in
prose and verse. The shooting of the King and the other archer
is described in prose as I have told it in <a href="#Page_144"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 144</a>, and both the
death of Earl Hugh and the general picture of the battle are
given in vigorous verse from the minstrelsy of Biorn Cripplehand
(<span lang="is" xml:lang="is">Biörn inn Krepphendi</span>). Besides the verses which Laing translates,
the Saga gives others from another poet, Gisl, who vigorously
describes the fight between the King and those whom he calls the
<a name="Page_622" id="Page_622"></a><span class="pageno">622</span>
<em>Welsh</em> Earls (Valsea Jarla), meaning doubtless rather Gal-Welsh
than Bret-Welsh;</p>

<p>The relations between Magnus and the Irish King Murtagh are
very puzzling. Orderic must have made some mistake when he
attributes the expedition of Magnus to a dispute with an Irish king
whose daughter he marries and sends back again (767 C, D). This
must surely be a confusion between Magnus himself and his son
Sigurd, who, according to the Saga, did marry the Irish king’s
daughter. But it is possible that Orderic’s story about the Irish
princess being sent back again, because her father did not fulfil
the marriage contract, may be true of Sigurd, though not of his
father. We should thus better understand the transactions which
go on a little later about the marriage of a daughter of Murtagh,
seemingly the same, to Arnulf son of Earl Roger (see <a href="#Page_442"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 442</a>). The
Manx writer has nothing to say about these marriages, but he
fills up the space between this expedition of Magnus and that
in which he fell with some very strange dealings between
Magnus and Murtagh. Magnus sends his shoes to the Irish
king, bidding him bear them on his shoulders in public as a sign
of subjection to their owner (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Murecardo regi Yberniæ misit calceamenta
sua, præcipiens ei ut ea super humeros suos in die natalis
Domini per medium domus suæ portaret in conspectu nunciorum
ejus, quatinus intelligeret se subjectum esse Magno regi”</span>). The
Irish are naturally angry; but their king takes matters more
quietly. He would willingly not only carry the shoes but eat
them, sooner than a single province of Ireland should be laid
waste. So he did as he was bid (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“rex, saniori consilio usus,
non solum, inquit, calceamenta ejus portare, verum etiam manducare
mallem, quam Magnus rex unam provinciam in Ybernia
destrueret. Itaque complevit præceptum et nuncios honoravit”</span>).
The Irish writers of course know nothing about the shoes; but
<a name="Page_623" id="Page_623"></a><span class="pageno">623</span>
the Chronicon Scotorum records a year’s peace made in 1098
between Murtagh and Magnus (“Magnus ri Lochlainne”). The
Manx chronicler also goes on to say that a treaty followed the
ceremony of the shoes, but that the ambassadors of Magnus gave
such a report of the charms of Ireland, that he determined to
invade it again in breach of the treaty.</p>

<p>This brings us to the date of the last expedition of Magnus. The
Chronicon Scotorum records the death of Magnus (“Magnus ri
Lochlainne ocus na Ninnsit”) in 1099 in an attack on Ulster.
But this date must be too early. The Norwegian account places
the second expedition of Magnus nine years after his accession in
Norway (Laing, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 143, Johnstone, 239). This would fix its date
to 1102. This is the date commonly given, with 1103, as the year
of his death. The Manx writer places the death of Magnus six
years after his first expedition (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“regnavit in regno insularum sex
annis,”</span> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 7), which would put his death in 1104. But he gives
1102 as the date of his successor in the island kingdom, Olaf the
son of Godred Crouan (see <a href="#Page_137"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 137</a>). He was, it seems, at the English
court; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quo [Magno] mortuo, miserunt principes insularum
propter Olavum filium Godredi Crouan, de quo superius mentionem
fecimus, qui tunc temporis degebat in curia Henrici regis
Angliæ filii Willelmi, et adduxerunt eum.”</span></p>

<p>The date of 1102 exactly falls in with the account of the attempt
of Robert of Bellême to obtain help from Magnus in that year (see
<a href="#Page_442"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 442</a>). For this I have followed the account in the Brut (1100;
that is 1102). But it would seem that the Welsh writer was mistaken
in saying that Magnus “sent over to Ireland, and demanded
the daughter of Murchath for his son; for that person was the
chiefest of the Gwyddelians; which he joyfully obtained; and he
set up that son to be king in the Isle of Man.” His death is recorded
in the next year, 1101 (1103), when “Magnus King of
Germany” (“Vagnus vrenhin Germania”) is made to invade Britain
and be killed by the Britons, who are said to have come “from the
mouths of the caves in multitudes like ants in pursuit of their spoils.”
Another manuscript for “Prydein” reads “Llẏchljẏn,” that is Denmark,
which does not make matters much better. The followers of
Magnus are called in the one manuscript “Albanians” (“yr Albanóyr”),
meaning doubtless Scots; in the other manuscript they
are men of Denmark (“gwyr Denmarc”). The Annales Cambriæ
<a name="Page_624" id="Page_624"></a><span class="pageno">624</span>
do not mention the dealings between Robert of Bellême and Magnus;
but there is an entry under 1103; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Magnus rex apud Dulin
[Dublin?] occiditur.”</span></p>

<p>The death of Magnus in his second Irish expedition is told with
great detail in the Saga (Johnstone, 239&ndash;244; Laing, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 143&ndash;147).
Orderic also tells the story in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 812. The Irish, according to this
account, call in Arnulf of Montgomery to their help; but, when
Magnus is killed, the Irish try to kill Arnulf and his Norman companions.
Murtagh now takes away his daughter from Arnulf, and
marries her, according to the irregular fashion of the country, to a
kinsman (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ipsam petulantem cuidam consobrino suo illicite conjunxit”</span>).
But twenty years later, Arnulf, by that time an old
man, is reconciled to Murtagh, marries his daughter, and dies the
next day. This carries us beyond the range of my story, and I
must leave Irish, Norwegian, and Norman enquirers to see to it.
It concerns me more that it is now that Orderic mentions the great
treasure which Magnus had left with a rich citizen of Lincoln.
(See <a href="#Page_134"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 134</a>.) The Lincoln man seems to have thought that the
death of the Norwegian king gave his banker a right to his money;
but King Henry thought otherwise, and took the twenty thousand
pounds to his own hoard.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Relations between Hildebert and Helias.</p>

<p><span class="sc">There</span> is a remarkable difference of tone between Orderic and
the Biographer of the Bishops of Le Mans in their way of
speaking of Helias. That the Count should be blamed for making
Bishop Howel a prisoner (see <a href="#Page_198"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 198</a>) is in no way wonderful;
the thing to be noticed is the way in which he several times
speaks of Helias during the episcopate of Hildebert; still more
remarkable is the way in which Hildebert speaks himself. Orderic
always puts the acts of Helias in the best light; the Biographer,
during certain parts of his story at least, seems well-pleased to
throw in any little insinuation against him. Perhaps the strangest
case of all is the way in which he leaves out all mention of the
double appointment to the see of Le Mans on the death of Howel
<a name="Page_625" id="Page_625"></a><span class="pageno">625</span>
(see <a href="#Page_211"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 211</a>), and of the action of Helias in that matter. One
would have thought that, even from an ecclesiastical point of
view, the story told more for Helias than against him. He put
forth a claim which any other prince of his time would have equally
put forward; he withdrew it in a way in which very few princes
of his time would have withdrawn it. But the Biographer (see
<a href="#Page_297"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 297</a>) lets us into the fact that there had been an opposition
to Hildebert’s election in the Chapter itself. Could his enemies
have been special partisans of Helias, and supporters of his
candidate? If so, it is rather strange, though quite possible, that
they should have been the accusers of Hildebert to Rufus, when
the charge brought against him was that of being a confederate
with Helias.</p>

<p>The Biographer is quite loyal to Helias during the campaign of
1098. He brings out prominently (see <a href="#Page_213"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 213</a>, note) the cause of the
war, namely the election of Hildebert by the Chapter and his
acceptance by the Count, without any regard to the alleged claims
of the Norman Dukes. Helias was in fact fighting on behalf of
Hildebert. When Helias is taken prisoner, he raises a wail&mdash;“proh
dolor” (see above, <a href="#Page_223"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 223</a>)&mdash;which almost reminds us of
Florence’s wail over the death-wound of Harold. He brings out
strongly the Red King’s wrath against Hildebert, as shown in his
ravages at Coulaines (see <a href="#Page_234"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 234</a>). He brings out also, what
Orderic does not mention, the friendly relations between Hildebert
and Helias which are shown in the negotiations which led to
the Count’s release (see <a href="#Page_238"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 238</a>). We may perhaps infer that, during
this stage, the friendship between the Count and the Bishop
remained unbroken, and that the Biographer remains the Count’s
friend so long as the Bishop does.</p>

<p>During the campaign of 1099 the Biographer’s tone becomes
quite different. He has not a word to say about the zeal of
the citizens of Le Mans on behalf of Helias, which comes out so
strongly in Orderic, and after him in Wace (see <a href="#Page_279"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 279</a>). He rather
implies that they fought against him. The enemies who meet him
at Pontlieue are <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“milites regis <em>cum populo</em>”</span> (see <a href="#Page_278"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 278</a>, note 2).
It is quite possible that, as the Normans had military possession of
the city, its levies may have been made, even against their will, to
take their place in the Norman ranks, and the presence of such
unwilling allies may have very likely helped to bring about the
<a name="Page_626" id="Page_626"></a><span class="pageno">626</span>
Norman defeat. Still the insertion of the words without any
comment or qualification gives the Biographer’s story a different
turn from that of Orderic. Yet the Biographer himself after
all allows that Helias entered Le Mans with the good-will of
the citizens, when he allows (see <a href="#Page_297"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 297</a>) the accusers of Hildebert
to say <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quando Helias comes <em>consentientibus civibus</em> civitatem
occupavit.”</span> He next leaves out the fact recorded by Orderic (see
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 297) that, before William Rufus had crossed the frontier, Hildebert
met him and was received to his peace, on affirming that
he had no share in the enterprise of Helias. There is nothing
wonderful in this. It is a case which often happens. The original
cause of a war is forgotten, and the fault of the original enemy is
forgiven, when a new enemy has given fresh offence. William was
so wroth at Helias for seizing Le Mans, that he forgot any quarrels
of earlier date. If Hildebert was clear on that score, William could
pass by all that had gone before. He was therefore at this
moment ready to forgive Hildebert in his wrath against Helias.
But the old enemies of Hildebert in the Chapter were ready, for the
sake of the old grudge, to turn against Helias. The chances are
that Hildebert had nothing to do with the return of Helias, but
that the towers of the cathedral were turned by Helias to military
uses. Hildebert most likely deemed&mdash;&#8203;and, as events proved,
more wisely than either the Count or the citizens&mdash;&#8203;that the enterprise
of Helias was rash, and therefore unjustifiable. This would
turn him, at least for the time, into an enemy of Helias, if not
into a partisan of Rufus. The Biographer takes up this tone.
It may be with a little feeling of spite that he records (see <a href="#Page_281"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 281</a>)
the way in which the loyalty of the citizens towards the Count not
unnaturally cooled after the fire. There is certainly such a feeling
in the passage (see <a href="#Page_287"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 287</a>) where he speaks of Helias as flying,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“saluti suæ consulens,”</span> while Orderic rather describes him as swept
away in a general flight. But this tone lasts only through the
year 1099. When Helias comes back in 1100, all seems to be made
up again; we now hear (Vet. An. 309, 311) of the “liberalitas”
of the “liberalis comes;” the Normans are “hostes” and Helias
brings back peace. That is to say, as the story shows, the Count
and the Bishop were again reconciled, and the Biographer follows
the lead of the Bishop.</p>

<p>But we need not wonder at the tone of the Biographer, if we
<a name="Page_627" id="Page_627"></a><span class="pageno">627</span>
know the tone of the Bishop himself. In a letter printed in
Duchèsne’s French collection, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 247, Hildebert speaks of a space
of three years, “peractum triennium,” within which time Le Mans
has had six counts, all of them enemies to peace (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“tam modico
tempore sex in urbe sustinuimus consules, quorum nullus pacificum
prætendens ingressum, gladiis et igne curtam sibi vendicavit
potestatem.”</span> It is certainly very hard to reckon up six counts
in three years, seemingly the years 1096&ndash;1099. In twelve years
(1087&ndash;1099) not more than five counts&mdash;&#8203;William the Great,
Robert, Hugh, Helias, William Rufus&mdash;&#8203;can be made out, unless
Helias, with his two reigns, is reckoned twice over. Hildebert
then goes on;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Plebe coacta in favorem, tyrannum suscepit ex necessitate, non
ducem ex lege: in susceptum studia simulavit, non exhibuit. Fidem
reperit in ea, quia superior. Consul vero tanto gravius dominatus
est quanto brevius. Miles ejus simulatis usus injuriis, eos scelerum
judicavit expertes quos rerum. Et quia non parcit populis regnum
breve, finem rapinis inopia posuit, non voluntas.”</p>

<p>This certainly reads most like a description of the reign of
Hugh; but in what follows we surely see the events of 1098
and 1099;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ea clades usque ad sanctuarium Domini pervagata est, et primo
<em>quidquid extra muros nostræ fuerat potestatis</em>, vel evanuit in
favillas vel dissipatum est in rapinam. Deinde similibus cecidere
præjudiciis episcopales domus et ecclesiæ non paucæ. In reliquis
quibus ignis pepercit æque periclitata est et facultas pauperum et
reverentia sacerdotum. Omnia confracta sunt, omnia direpta, omnia
contaminata. Nihil eorum manus evasit qui gratis ad flagitium discurrunt,
ad honestum nec pretio.”</p>

<p>To what does all this refer? It reads most like a description
of the Red King’s harryings at Coulaines in 1098 (see <a href="#Page_234"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 234</a>); but
no one is mentioned, whereas the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex Anglicus”</span> and his
“tyrannis” are openly spoken of further on in the letter. And
it is strange, if in all this there is no reference to the fire of 1099.
Did Hildebert attribute the fire to Helias, and does that account
for any enmity towards him? Yet the version of the Biographer
as clearly makes the fire the work of the Normans as the version
of Orderic. Helias is not mentioned by name, nor is any recorded
act of his distinctly mentioned. The passage is obscure, most
<a name="Page_628" id="Page_628"></a><span class="pageno">628</span>
likely purposely obscure. It might be so construed as to attribute
all mischief to Helias; it might be so construed as not to lay
any particular act to his charge. But in any case Helias would
at least come under the general condemnation which is pronounced
upon all the counts of Maine, be they six or fewer. No friend of
Helias could have so spoken; and it is plain that, when Bishop
Hildebert wrote the letter, he was&mdash;&#8203;very naturally&mdash;&#8203;not a little
angry, if not with Helias in particular, yet at least with a class
of men among whom Helias must be reckoned.</p>

<p>Of the rest of the letter I shall have to speak in another
Note.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Surrender of Le Mans to William Rufus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is not very easy at first sight to reconcile our accounts of the
negotiations which led to the surrender of Le Mans in August 1098.
Yet there seems to be no direct contradiction of any moment. It
seems not impossible that the difference is merely one of those cases
where one writer gives prominence to some feature in the story
which another writer leaves out.</p>

<p>According to all accounts, Le Mans was at this time in the
possession of Fulk of Anjou. Orderic (see <a href="#Page_237"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 237</a>) makes him
personally present in the city; the Biographer of the Bishops does
not say whether he was there or not. But in any case the city had
admitted his authority in May and had not yet thrown it off. Fulk
was therefore fully in a position to negotiate with William, while
Helias, who was a prisoner in William’s hands, was not strictly in a
position to negotiate with anybody. Yet the Biographer makes no
mention of Fulk as an actor or a party to the treaty, but only as
one of whose devices Helias was afraid. In his version Bishop
Hildebert and some of the chief men of Le Mans first, by the
King’s leave, visit the captive Count, and agree on terms with him;
then they draw up a treaty with the King according to those terms.
The tale runs thus (Vet. An. 306);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Helias timens ne Fulco comes proscriptioni ejus intenderet,
manduvit ad se episcopum et quosdam ex primoribus civitatis ex
<a name="Page_629" id="Page_629"></a><span class="pageno">629</span>
consensu regis, et cœpit agere cum eis, eosque suppliciter deprecari,
quatenus casibus illius condolentes, modis omnibus niterentur,
qualiter civitatem regi traderent, ipsumque a vinculis liberarent.
Timebat enim quod Fulco comes, regis deceptus muneribus, cum
eo pacem faceret, atque civitate tradita perpetuo damnaretur exsilio.
Episcopus autem et qui cum eo venerant, ejus angustias miserantes,
cum rege de ejus liberatione locuti, cum eo tale pactum fecerunt, ut
si eorum consilio atque ingenio sibi civitas traderetur, ipse Heliam
comitem quietum et liberum abire permitteret.”</p>

<p>He adds, hurrying matters a little; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quod negotium industria
præsulis celerius quam sperabatur effectum, eodemque tempore et
regi civitas et consuli abeundi libertas reddita est.”</span></p>

<p>Orderic, on the other hand (772 D), has a version in which there
is no mention of any dealings with Helias, but which makes William
and Fulk&mdash;&#8203;the latter, it would seem, under some pressure&mdash;&#8203;agree
on terms substantially the same as those stated in the other account.
His version runs thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Andegavenses autem cum Cenomannis consiliati sunt, et sese
Normannis in omnibus inferiores compererunt, unde colloquium
inter regem et consulem procuraverunt. Ibi tunc, auxiliante Deo,
necessaria pax inter eos facta est, et inde multis pro pluribus causis
utriusque populi gaudium ingens exortum est. Requisitum est et
concessum ut Helias comes et omnes qui capti fuerant ex utraque
parte redderentur, et Cenomannis et <em>omnia castra quæ Guillelmus
rex habuerat Rufo filio ejus subjugarentur</em>.”</p>

<p>The joy of which Orderic speaks clearly did not extend to
Angers. The Chronicle of Saint Albinus (1098) puts things in
quite another light; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quam [Cenomanniam urbem] tribus mensibus
retentam, Cenomanensibus, more suo, sibi fraudantibus et a
se deficientibus, reddidit eam in amicitia præfato regi Anglorum,
qui ipsam urbem <em>magis pecunia quam viribus impugnabat</em> jamque
pene possidebat.”</span></p>

<p>Here we have no mention of Helias or of any dealings with him,
nothing of any agreement between Fulk and William. The citizens
of Le Mans fall away from the Angevin Count and betray their
city to the King. And they fall away through the temptation
which the Red King knew well how to bring to bear upon his
other enemies, but of which there is no recorded instance in the
whole history of the war of Maine. See <a href="#Page_290"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 290</a>.
<a name="Page_630" id="Page_630"></a><span class="pageno">630</span></p>

<p>The tone and effect of these stories is very different, and yet they
seem quite capable of being put together. It is simply that each
writer enlarges on the persons and things which he cares most
about. The Biographer of the Bishops of course enlarges on the
part taken by Hildebert; next to Hildebert, he has to tell of
Helias. A mission of Hildebert to Helias was a thing which he
could not leave out; the fact that the terms were settled between
his own Bishop and his own Count was more interesting to him
than the fact that those terms were put in the form of a formal treaty
between two foreign princes. He cannot leave out the Norman king,
but he can and does leave out the Angevin count. He speaks of
a treaty between William and Fulk as a thing which was likely to
happen; he leaves out the fact that it actually did happen. The
Angevin Chronicler is angry at the loss of Le Mans, and is glad
to speak of its loss as due altogether to Cenomannian treason
or fickleness. Orderic alone, who is, more strictly than either of
the others, telling the history of the campaign, and who is less
influenced by local passion one way or another, brings out the diplomatic
fact that the treaty was formally agreed to in a meeting
between King William and Count Fulk. It must have taken the
shape of an agreement of some kind between them, unless Fulk and
his troops had been driven out of Le Mans by force. But this
in no way shuts out the possibility of the dealings between Hildebert
and Helias which are described by the Biographer. The state
of things would seem to be this. The people of Le Mans, tired of
Fulk, unable to have Helias, think that the best thing is to submit
to William, but on terms which will secure at least the personal
freedom of their native prince. Hildebert and his companions are
allowed by William to confer with Helias. The results of the conference
are put into the shape of a treaty between William and Fulk.
Fulk is in no condition to resist William and the Cenomannian people
together; he therefore accepts the treaty, doubtless against his will.
Thus the accounts of Orderic and the Biographer seem simply to
fill up gaps in one another. The Angevin chronicler simply gives
a short and snarling summary of the actual result.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Fortresses of Le Mans.</p>

<p><span class="sc">A great</span> deal about the walls and the castle of Le Mans, as well
as about several other points in the county of Maine, will be found
in <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hucher’s book, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études sur l’Histoire et les Monuments du
Département de la Sarthe</cite> (Le Mans and Paris, 1856). <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hucher
however hardly carries his researches beyond the city itself; so that,
while his remarks and the documents which he quotes tell us much
about the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“regia turris,”</span> the castle close to the cathedral, he has
but little to tell us about the fortress of Mont-Barbé, which is for
our purpose of at least equal interest.</p>

<p>I have quoted elsewhere (<abbr title="Norman Conquest three">N. C. iii.</abbr> 207) some of the passages
which record the building of at least two castles by the Conqueror,
the royal tower and that of Mont-Barbé. In the extract from
William of Jumièges for “<em>p</em>onte Barbato” we must read “<em>m</em>onte.”
Benoît, oddly enough, knew the name of Mont-Barbé, but did not
know that of the royal tower (35735);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Por ce i ferma deus chasteaus</div>
<div class="i0">Hauz, defensables, forz e beaus;</div>
<div class="i0">Li uns en out non Monbarbé:</div>
<div class="i0">Mais que issi fu apelé</div>
<div class="i0">Ne sai retraire ne ne truis.”</div>
</div>

<p>Wace, on the other hand (15014), in his wild chronology of all
Cenomannian matters, makes William Rufus build this castle in
the expedition of 1099;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Li Reis vint el Mans fièrement,</div>
<div class="i0">Son hostel prist vers Saint Vincent.</div>
<div class="i0">Por grever cels de la cité</div>
<div class="i0">Fist la mote devant Barbé.”</div>
</div>

<p>But this story, though utterly out of its place, may possibly preserve
a fact. The royal tower was undoubtedly built by the Conqueror after
he had taken Le Mans in 1063 in order to secure the possession of the
city. But Mont Barbé looks rather like one of the besieging castles
made in order to get possession. Nothing is now left but the mound.
William may conceivably have found this mound ready made. If
not, his building of 1063 must have been of wood, though it may
very likely have had a stone successor. The mound, not far from
Saint Vincent’s abbey, stands in a private garden, and the visitor
to Le Mans, unless he has local guidance, may very likely fail to
<a name="Page_632" id="Page_632"></a><span class="pageno">632</span>
find it. I missed it at my first visit in 1868, which must be my
excuse for the rather vague language in the third volume of the
Norman Conquest. I saw it for the first time in 1876, through
the kindness of <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Henri Chardon, and again in 1879 with Mr.
Parker and Mr. Fowler.</p>

<p>The question remains, Was there a Mons <em>Barbatulus</em> as well as
a Mons <em>Barbatus</em>? The passages quoted from Orderic and William
of Jumièges (<abbr title="Norman Conquest volume three page">N. C. vol. iii. p.</abbr> 207) seem to imply it; only the odd
thing is that the words of William of Jumièges seem to leave out
the royal tower, and to speak of <em>Barbatus</em> and <em>Barbatulus</em> only.
And one might take the words of Wace, “La mote <em>devant</em> Barbé,”
to mean <em>Barbatulus</em> rather than <em>Barbatus</em>; only it would be hard
to find another <em>mota</em>. <em>Barbatulus</em> is conjecturally, but with every
likelihood, placed on the site of the present Lyceum, between
<em>Barbatus</em> and the city.</p>

<p>The royal tower was built just outside the Roman wall, two of
whose bastions, known as <span class="title" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Tour Margot</span>&mdash;after Margaret, the
promised bride of Robert?&mdash;and <span class="title">La Tour du Cavalier</span>, were taken
into its precinct. All these must be distinguished from the palace
of the Counts (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume three page">N. C. vol. iii. p.</abbr> 205) which stands on the Roman
wall, almost in a line with the east end of the cathedral. It contains
a window of the twelfth century, of great width, a feature
characteristic of Le Mans. In this palace was the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sainte chapelle</em>
of the Counts.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Dates of the Building of Le Mans Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> more than once, in the History of the Norman Conquest,
had to speak of the dates of the various parts of the church of Saint
Julian at Le Mans. The subject is so closely connected with so
many names which appear in our story that an inquiry of this kind
can hardly be thought out of place. My later visits to Le Mans
have enabled me to examine and consider several points again; and
I am now inclined to think that there is very little, if anything,
standing in the present church of an earlier date than William the
Conqueror’s first taking of Le Mans in 1063. I have got some
<a name="Page_633" id="Page_633"></a><span class="pageno">633</span>
help from a local book, called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Recherches sur la Cathédrale du
Mans. Par L’Abbé….”</span> (Le Mans, 1872); but its architectural
criticism is not of a high order. Another local book, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“L’Ancien
Chapitre Cathédral du Mans, par Armand Bellée, Archiviste de la
Sarthe”</span> (Le Mans, 1875), is a very thorough piece of capitular
history, but it throws little light on the architecture.</p>

<p>The earliest church of which we have any certain account was a
basilica of the ninth century. Saint Aldric, bishop from 832
to 856, rebuilt the cathedral church, of which he consecrated the
eastern part in 834 and the rest in 835. I have for these dates to
trust the author of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Recherches sur la Cathédrale du Mans,”</span>
who quotes from a manuscript life of Aldric in the library at
Le Mans. (I have seen the volume, and I could wish that it
was in print.) The time allowed for the building is wonderfully
short; but Aldric, if he did all that is attributed to him by
the Biographer of the Bishops (Vet. An. 276), must have been
a man of wonderful energy. There is nothing said directly of
his works at Saint Julian’s; but they might almost be taken for
granted when we hear of the many churches which he built and
restored (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ædificia quæ prædictus pontifex multipliciter a novo
operatus est, et ecclesias sive nonnulla monasteria quæ a novo
fundavit atque perficere et ornare studuit, necnon et restaurationes
aliorum monasteriorum et ceterarum ecclesiarum,”</span> <abbr title="et cetera et cetera et cetera">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c</abbr>). In
the days of the next Bishop Robert (856&ndash;885) Le Mans was sacked
by the Northmen and the church burned. We are of course met
by the usual difficulty as to the amount of destruction which is
implied in words of this kind; but it naturally led to a restoration,
and to a new dedication, on which last point however it seems to
have been thought needful to consult the Pope (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Matrem ecclesiam,
a paganis incensam, diligenti studio renovavit, et ex consilio Romani
antistitis jam denuo celeberrime consecravit;”</span> 287*). We hear
again (296*) of a dedication under Bishop Mainard (940&ndash;960); but
not of any rebuilding, just as in some of the intermediate episcopates
(Vet. An. 288* <abbr title="et sequentia">et seqq.</abbr>) we hear a good deal about havoc and
desecration, but nothing about actual destruction. The church of
Aldric, allowing for the restorations of Robert and any later repairs,
seems plainly to have stood till the days of Vulgrin (1055&ndash;1067),
the earliest Bishop of Le Mans who has even an indirect share
in the building of the present church. No work of his, unless
<a name="Page_634" id="Page_634"></a><span class="pageno">634</span>
possibly the merest fragments, seems to be now standing; but he
was the beginner of a great work of rebuilding which gave us what
we now see.</p>

<p>In the Life of Vulgrin (Vet. An. 312*) we are simply told that
in 1060 he began the foundations of a new church on a greater
scale (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quinto ordinationis suæ anno fundamenta matris ecclesiæ
ampliora quam fuerant, inchoavit, sed morte inopina superveniente
perficere non potuit”</span>). His foundations were badly laid and his
work was unskilful; so that, while attempts were making under his
successor Arnold (1067&ndash;1082) to prop it up, it fell down. Arnold
accordingly destroyed the whole work of Vulgrin, and began again
from a new foundation. The extent of his work is clearly marked.
He finished the eastern limb, as far as its walls and outer roof were
concerned; its internal adornments he left for his successor. Of
the transepts with their towers he merely laid the foundations;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Fabrica novæ ecclesiæ quam præsul Vulgrinus inchoaverat,
fundamentorum mobilitate atque lapidum debilitate corrupta, innumera
crepidine ruinam suam cœpit terribiliter minitari; quam
dum artifices fulcire conantur, repentino fragore nocturno tempore
collapsa est…. Inde … episcopus totam cœpti operis fabricam
usque ad ima fundamenta destruens, denuo ipsam ecclesiam
fundamento firmiori et solidiori lapide construere cœpit, et parti
superiori quæ vulgo cancellum nominatur etiam tectum imposuit,
membrorum quoque quæ cruces vocantur atque turrium solidissima
fundamenta antequam moreretur instituens” (313*).</p>

<p>That he added only the outer roof is plain from what we read of
his successor Howel (Vet. An. 289). As Howel adorned the “cancellum”
with a pavement and stained glass windows, he also added
a painted ceiling;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cancellum quod ejus antecessor construxerat pavimento decoravit
et cœlo, vitreas quoque per ipsum cancellum, per quod cruces
circum quoque laudabili sed sumptuosa nimium artis varietate
disponens.”</p>

<p>So again, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 299;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cœpit … superiores partes ejusdem basilicæ diligenti sollicitudine
laborare, oratorium scilicet quod chorum vocitant sedemque
pontificalem, altaria congrua dimensione disponere, pavimenta substernere,
columnas ac laquearia gratissima varietate depingere,
parietes per circuitum dealbare.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635"></a><span class="pageno">635</span>
Howel also finished the transepts and towers of which Arnold
had merely laid the foundations (Vet. An. 289);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Fabricam novæ ecclesiæ … tanto studio aggressus est consummare
ut cruces atque turres, quarum antecessor ipsius … jecerat
fundamenta brevi tempore ad effectum perduxit.”</p>

<p>We see then what the work of Vulgrin and Arnold was. It
touched the eastern part only; Aldric’s nave was left alone. The
original church was a basilica, most likely with three apses, but
without transepts. The new design was to rebuild the eastern
part on a greater scale with transepts, transept towers (like Geneva
and Exeter), and a choir ending in an apse with a surrounding
aisle and chapels&mdash;&#8203;as is shown by the mention of many altars. The
arrangement was that of the two other great churches of Le Mans,
<span class="title">La Couture</span> and Saint Julian in the Meadow, with the single exception
of the towers, which do not appear in either of those churches.
Arnold built the choir, and began the transepts and towers; Howel
adorned the choir and finished the transepts and towers. There is
nothing to imply that either of them touched the nave. The arcades
of Aldric’s basilica were therefore still standing when William the
Great came in 1063 and again in 1073. The work of Vulgrin in
the eastern part was doubtless going on at the earlier of those
two dates, and that of Arnold at the later.</p>

<p>It must be plain to every one who has seen the building that
the work of these bishops in the eastern part of the church has
given way to the later choir and transepts. The choir was built
between 1218 and 1254, and its great extension to the east involved,
as at Lincoln, the destruction of part of the Roman wall.
The transepts were built at several times from 1303 to 1424.
They are among the very noblest works of the architecture of those
centuries; but we may be allowed to rejoice that, as the works
of Vulgrin and Arnold left Aldric’s nave standing, so the great
works of the thirteenth century and later have left the nave which
succeeded that of Aldric. With all its artistic loveliness, the
work of the later day cannot share the historic interest of the
works of the times of William and Howel, of Helias and Hildebert.</p>

<p>In the present nave it is plain at the first glance that there are
two dates of Romanesque; a further examination may perhaps lead
to the belief that there are more than two. It is easy to see outside
that the aisles and the clerestory are of different dates. The
<a name="Page_636" id="Page_636"></a><span class="pageno">636</span>
masonry of the aisles is of that Roman type which, in places like
Le Mans, where Roman models were abundant, remained in use
far into the middle ages, and which in some places can hardly be
said to have ever gone out of use at all. The masonry of the clerestory
is ashlar. The difference is equally clear between the plain
single windows of the aisles and the highly finished coupled windows
of the clerestory. Inside, the eye soon sees that the design has
undergone a singular change. Without the pulling down of any
part, the church put on a new character. Columns supporting
round arches after the manner of a basilica were changed into a
series of alternate columns and square piers supporting obtusely
pointed arches. Each pair of arches therefore forms a couplet, and
answers to a single bay of the pointed vaulting and a single pair of
windows in the clerestory. The object clearly was to give the
building as nearly the air of an Angevin nave, like that of La
Couture (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 619), as could be given where there
were real piers and arches. Now this reconstruction, one which
brings in the pointed arch, cannot possibly be earlier than the
episcopate of William of Passavant, Bishop from 1143 to 1187.
He was a great builder; he translated the body of Saint Julian
(Vet. An. 366); he celebrated a dedication of the church (Ib. 370),
which my local book fixes, seemingly from manuscripts, to 1158, a
date a little early perhaps for such advanced work, but not impossible.
To William of Passavant then we must attribute the recasting
of the nave, and whatever else seems to be of the same date.
To this last head belongs the great south porch, and, I should be
inclined to add, the lower part of the southern, the only remaining,
tower, though some assign it to Hildebert. The question now
comes, What was the nave which William of Passavant recast in
this fashion, and whose work was it?</p>

<p>We have seen that we cannot attribute any work in the nave to
any prelate earlier than Howel. He must have found the nave
of the ninth century still standing. Did he do anything in that
part of the church? He performed a ceremony of dedication in
1093 (Vet. An. 300); but that would be fully accounted for by
his works in the eastern part. On the other hand, Hildebert
celebrated in 1120 (Vet. An. 320) a specially solemn dedication,
and the words used seem to imply that the church was now
complete in all its parts. The words of Orderic (531 D) seem
<a name="Page_637" id="Page_637"></a><span class="pageno">637</span>
express. Howel began to build the church (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“episcopalem basilicam
… condere cœpit”</span>); Hildebert finished it (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“basilicam
episcopii quam prædecessor ejus inchoaverat, consummavit, et
cum ingenti populorum tripudio veneranter dedicavit”</span>). It is
doubtless not strictly true that Howel began the church, words
which shut out the work of Vulgrin and Arnold; but the time
when Orderic wrote makes him a better authority for Hildebert’s
finishing than for Howel’s beginning, and the expression
might easily be used if Howel began that particular work, namely
the nave, which Hildebert finished. I do not think that we need
infer from certain expressions of the Biographer that Hildebert left
the nave, or any essential part of the building, unfinished. He
says indeed (Vet. An. 320);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hildebertus opus ecclesiæ, quod per longa tempora protractum
fuerat, suo tempore insistens consummare, dedicationem ultra quam
res exposcebat accelerans, multa inibi necessaria inexpleta præteriit.”</p>

<p>Comparing this with the words of Orderic, this surely need not
mean more than that, though the fabric was perfect, yet much of
the ornamental work was left unfinished. Hildebert, in short, left
the nave much as Arnold left the choir. At least the nave was
in this case when he dedicated the church. For he had time
after the dedication to make good anything that was imperfect.</p>

<p>We should then infer from Orderic that the nave which William
of Passavant recast was begun by Howel and finished by Hildebert.
This may give us the key to a passage in the Biographer on which
we might otherwise be inclined to put another meaning. After
describing Howel’s building of the transepts in the words quoted
above in <a href="#Page_635"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 635</a>, he goes on (289);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eisque [crucibus] celeriter culmen imponens, exteriores etiam
parietes, quos alas vocant, per circuitum consummavit.”</p>

<p>One might have been tempted to take this of transept aisles;
but, weighing one thing with another, it seems to be best understood
as meaning that Howel rebuilt the whole of the outer walls
of the nave and its aisles. This would give to him the whole
extent of the <em>quasi</em>-Roman work of the aisles, together with the
great western doorway. The interior work of the aisles seems also
to agree with his date. We must therefore suppose that Howel
rebuilt the nave aisles only, still leaving the arches of Aldric’s
basilica. Then Hildebert rebuilt or thoroughly restored the nave
<a name="Page_638" id="Page_638"></a><span class="pageno">638</span>
itself, with the columns and arches and whatever they carried in
the way of triforium and clerestory. We may therefore suppose
that the existing columns, as distinguished from the square piers,
are his work, though the splendid capitals of many of them must
have been added or carved out of the block in the recasting by
William of Passavant.</p>

<p>There is however one fragment of the nave arcades which is older
than Hildebert, very likely older than Howel. This is to be seen in
the first pier from the east. I need not say that the eastern bay of
a nave often belongs to an older work than the rest, being in truth
part of the eastern limb continued so far&mdash;&#8203;perhaps for constructive
reasons, to act as a buttress&mdash;&#8203;perhaps for ritual reasons, to mark the
ritual choir&mdash;&#8203;very often for both reasons combined. One of the best
examples is that small part of the nave of Durham abbey which
belongs to the work of William of Saint-Calais (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v.
p.</abbr> 631). At this point then in the nave of Le Mans, we find half
columns with capitals and bases of a strangely rude kind, more like
Primitive Romanesque (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five pages">N. C. vol. v. pp.</abbr> 613, 618, 628) than
anything either Norman or Angevin. These are assuredly not the
work of Hildebert. There is one argument for assigning them to
Howel, namely that something of the same kind is to be found in
the remains of the northern tower of which I shall speak in another
Note (see below, <a href="#Note_RR">Note RR</a>). But if any one holds them to be the
work of Arnold or of Vulgrin, or even looks on them as a surviving
fragment of the basilica of the days of Lewis the Pious, I shall not
dispute against him.</p>

<p>I must add however that, between Hildebert and William of
Passavant, we have, according to the use of Le Mans, to account
for two fires&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“solita civitatis incendia,”</span> as the Biographer (Vet.
An. 349) calls them&mdash;&#8203;and their consequences. In 1134 there was a
fire which, according to the Biographer (350), was more fearful than
any which had ever happened at Le Mans since the city was built,
not even excepting the great one of 1098. Everything perished.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tota Cenomannensis civitas cum omnibus ecclesiis quæ intra
muros continebantur, evanuit in favillas.”</span> We read of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“matris
ecclesiæ destructio”</span> and “combustio,” all the more lamentable
because of its beauty&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ipsa enim tam venustate sui quam claritate
tunc temporis vicinis et remotis excellebat ecclesiis.”</span> So
Orderic (899 B); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tunc Cenomannis episcopalis basilica, quæ</span>
<a name="Page_639" id="Page_639"></a><span class="pageno">639</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulcherrima erat, concremata est.”</span> The then Bishop, Guy of
Étampes (1126&ndash;1136), spent two hundred pounds in trying to
repair the damage; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ad cujus restaurationem <abbr title="200">cc.</abbr> libras Cenomannenses
dedit, sine mora contulit, et omnibus modis desudavit
quomodo ipsa ad perpetuitatem decenter potuisset restaurari.”</span>
Under the next Bishop, Hugh of Saint-Calais (1146&ndash;1153), there
was another fire, the account of which is very curious (Vet. An.
349);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ignis circa meridiem a vico sancti Vincentii prosiliens, sibi
opposita usque ad muros civitatis et domos episcopales, tegmenque
sacelli beati Juliani adhuc stramineum, cum fenestris vitreis concremavit
et macerias, et in summis imagines sculptas lapidibus
deturbavit.”</p>

<p>The people break open the shrine of Saint Julian in order to
save his body, which they carry to the place where the Bishop was.
The Bishop seems to have repaired the episcopal buildings before
he touched the church, and the details have some interest in the
history of domestic architecture (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“domum petrinam ex parte sancti
Audoëni positam, decenti solariorum interpositu numerosas fenestras
habentium cum sua camera continuavit”</span>). Presently we read;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Beatissimum patrem nostrum Julianum ipso die a lignea
basilica in occidentali membro ecclesiæ intra macerias facta, post
incendium in qua fere triennio requieverat, in redivivam sollenniter,
clero cantibus insultante, populo congaudente, transtulerunt
ecclesiam.”</p>

<p>We do not hear of any more building, but there is a long list
(Vet. An. 354) of the ornaments which Bishop Hugh gave to the
Church.</p>

<p>Some of the expressions used in these passages are very odd.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sacellum beati Juliani”</span> is a strange phrase for the cathedral
church, and yet the thatched roof and the glass windows must
be spoken of a building and not of a mere shrine. It is Saint
Julian’s church itself whose roof and windows are spoken of. But
the phrase <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“lignea basilica,”</span> which makes one think of Glastonbury,
must not lead us to think that any wooden church of early days
was then standing at Le Mans. The whole story seems quite
intelligible, without supposing any really architectural work between
Hildebert and William of Passavant. The language of the Biographer
in describing the fire of 1134 is, as so often happens, very
<a name="Page_640" id="Page_640"></a><span class="pageno">640</span>
much exaggerated. His own account shows that the walls of the
church were left standing. It looks on the whole as if the roof
was destroyed in 1134. It was hastily repaired with thatch. It
was burned again, and the clerestory (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“fenestræ vitreæ”</span>) with it,
at the next fire in 1146&ndash;1153. The whole church perhaps remained
for a while unfit for divine service. Then some wooden structure
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“lignea basilica”</span>) was raised within the walls of the nave (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in
occidentali membro ecclesiæ intra macerias facta”</span>). Meanwhile
Bishop Hugh repaired the choir (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“rediviva ecclesia”</span>), seemingly
doing nothing to the nave. Bishop William, finding things in this
state, rebuilt the clerestory and vaulted it Angevin fashion. So
to do required that every alternate column of the nave should
be built up into a square pier. This again required a change in
the line of the arches, and, according to the fashion just coming
in, they were made obtusely pointed. If any one thinks that the
superb foliage of the nave capitals must be later than 1158, he
may hold that they were cut out afterwards, or he may even
hold that Bishop William’s dedication in that year belongs only to
the eastern parts&mdash;&#8203;where something was clearly done in his time
or thereabouts&mdash;&#8203;and that the whole recasting of the nave came
later in his long episcopate.</p>

<p class="p2">I am not writing an architectural history of the church of Saint
Julian, and I have perhaps, as it is, gone more into detail than
my subject called for. I think that any one who has been at
Le Mans will forgive me. But there are many architectural points
in this wonderful church on which I have not entered. There
is much also in the other two minsters of Le Mans which throws
much light on the work at Saint Julian’s. I have merely tried
in a general way to assign to their most probable dates and
founders the different parts of a church which so often meets us
in our present history.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Interview between William Rufus and Helias.</p>

<p><span class="sc">We</span> have two chief accounts of this remarkable interview, one
in Orderic, 773 B, the other in William of Malmesbury, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 320.
<a name="Page_641" id="Page_641"></a><span class="pageno">641</span>
As with some of the other anecdotes of William Rufus, Orderic
tells the story in its place as part of his regular narrative, while William
of Malmesbury brings it in, along with the story of his crossing
to Touques, as a mere anecdote, to illustrate the King’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“præclara
magnanimitas.”</span> And he tells the tale very distinctly out of its
place, for he puts it after the voyage to Touques, that is in the
campaign of 1099, whereas it is clear that it happened during the
campaign of 1098. One’s feelings are a little shocked when he
speaks of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“auctor turbarum, Helias <em>quidam</em>,”</span> which reminds one
of the meeting between the Count’s earlier namesake and another
tyrant (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“venit Achab in occursum Eliæ. Et cum vidisset eum, ait;
Tune es ille, qui conturbas Israël?”</span> 3 <abbr title="Kings eighteen">Regg. xviii.</abbr> 16). To be sure
he does afterwards speak of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“alta nobilitas”</span> of the Count
of Maine.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of difference in the details of the dialogue
in the two accounts. That in William of Malmesbury is much
shorter, and consists wholly of an exchange of short and sharp
sayings between the speakers, which are certainly very characteristic
of William Rufus. There is nothing in this version of the offer
of Helias to enter the King’s service, or of the counsel given by
Robert of Meulan. In Orderic’s version Helias speaks first, with
the offer of service, beginning <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex inclute, mihi, quæso, subveni
pro tua insigni strenuitate;”</span> and we read, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Liberalis rex hoc
facile annuere decrevit, sed Rodbertus Mellenticus comes pro felle
livoris dissuasit.”</span> Then, after speeches on both sides which are
not given, comes the defiance of Helias, in these words;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Libenter, domine rex, tibi servirem, si tibi placeret, gratiamque
apud te invenirem. Amodo mihi, quæso, noli derogare, si aliud
conabor perpetrare. Patienter ferre nequeo quod meam mihi
ablatam hæreditatem perspicio. Ex violentia prævalente omnis
mihi denegatur rectitudo. Quamobrem nemo miretur si calumniam
fecero, si avitum honorem totis nisibus repetiero.”</p>

<p>All this is represented in William of Malmesbury by two
sentences;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cui [Heliæ] ante se adducto rex ludibundus, ‘Habeo te,
magister,’ dixit. At vero illius alta nobilitas quæ nesciret in tanto
etiam periculo humilia sapere, humilia loqui; ‘Fortuitu,’ inquit,
‘me cepisti; sed si possem evadere, novi quid facerem.’”</p>

<p>This is very characteristic of Rufus; is it equally so of Helias?
<a name="Page_642" id="Page_642"></a><span class="pageno">642</span>
Surely the two speeches given to him by Orderic&mdash;&#8203;allowing for a
little improvement in the process of turning them into Latin&mdash;&#8203;much
better suit his character and position. And we can hardly fancy
that Helias’ offer to enter William’s service, the King’s inclination
to accept it, and the evil counsel given by Robert of Meulan&mdash;&#8203;all
likewise thoroughly characteristic&mdash;&#8203;are all mere invention.</p>

<p>The last speech of Rufus is much fuller in William of Malmesbury
than in Orderic. Orderic simply says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cui turgidus rex
ait, ‘Vade, et age quidquid mihi potes agere.’”</span> In the other version
this becomes;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tum Willelmus, præ furore extra se positus, et obuncans
Heliam, ‘Tu,’ inquit, ‘nebulo, tu, quid faceres? Discede, abi, fuge;
concedo tibi ut facias quidquid poteris; et, per vultum de Luca,
nihil, si me viceris, pro hac venia tecum paciscar.’”</p>

<p>He adds, without any mention of a regular safe-conduct,</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nec inferius factum verbo fuit, sed continuo dimisit evadere,
miratus potius quam insectatus fugientem.”</p>

<p class="p2">I have in the text followed the version of Orderic, venturing
only to add the eminently characteristic words with which William
of Malmesbury begins and ends. They in no way disturb the
main dialogue as given by Orderic. But I must add that William
of Malmesbury warns us against supposing that William Rufus,
either in this speech or in his speech on the voyage to Touques,
knowingly quoted Lucan. His words are curious;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quis talia de illiterato homine crederet? Et fortassis erit
aliquis qui, Lucanum legens, falso opinetur Willelmum hæc
exempla de Julio Cæsare mutuatum esse: sed non erat ei tantum
studii vel otii ut literas unquam audiret; immo calor mentis
ingenitus, et conscia virtus, eum talia exprimere cogebant. Et
profecto, si Christianitas nostra pateretur, sicut olim anima Euforbii
transisse dicta est in Pythagoram Samium, ita possit dici quod
anima Julii Cæsaris transierit in regem Willelmum.”</p>

<p>That is to say, Cæsar and William Rufus, being the same kind of
men, uttered the same kind of words. The passage of Lucan referred
to is where Domitius (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 512) is brought before Cæsar at Corfinium;</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="i0a">“Vive, licet nolis, et nostro munere, dixit,</div>
<div class="i0">Cerne diem, victis jam spes bona partibus esto,</div>
<div class="i0">Exemplumque mei: vel, si libet, arma retenta,</div>
<div class="i0">Et nihil hac venia, si viceris ipse, paciscor.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643"></a><span class="pageno">643</span>
That William Rufus should quote Lucan, as his brother Henry
could most likely have done, was so very unlikely that William of
Malmesbury need hardly have warned us against such a belief.
At the same time it does not seem impossible that he might have
heard of Cæsar without having read Lucan. But we must
remember that whatever William Rufus said was said in French,
and not in Latin. Without supposing either that Rufus had
read Lucan or that the soul of Cæsar had passed into his body,
we may believe that William of Malmesbury or his informant
could not resist the temptation of translating his speech into the
words of a really appropriate passage of a favourite author; then,
when he had done this, the singular apology which I have quoted
might seem needful.</p>

<p class="p2">It must be remembered that William of Malmesbury puts this
story altogether out of place. It is put yet further out of its place
by Wace (15106), who makes the capture of Helias follow the
siege of Mayet (see <a href="#Page_289"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 289</a>). His version brings in some new details.
Helias, having been taken prisoner, makes (15120) a boastful speech
to his keepers, swearing by the patron saint of his city that, if he
had not fallen by chance into an ambuscade, he would soon have
driven the King of England out of all his lands beyond the sea
(15120);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Mais or vos dirai une rien:</div>
<div class="i0">Par monseignor Saint-Julien,</div>
<div class="i0">Se jo ne fusse si tost pris,</div>
<div class="i0">Mult éust poi en cest païs.</div>
<div class="i0">El rei eusse fait tant guerre,</div>

<div class="i0">Maiz altrement est avenu,</div>
<div class="i0">Il a cunquis è jo perdu.”</div>

<p>When this is told to the King, he causes Helias to be brought
before him; he gives him a horse, and bids him mount and ride
whither he will; only he had better take care that he is not caught
again, as he will not be let out of prison a second time;</p>

In this version the horse is something new, though not at all
out of place, as Helias could not well get away without a horse,
and he could not have had any horse at his command at the
moment. We may note also that William is here made, whether
seriously or in mockery, to give Helias the title of Count,
“Dans quens.” But the story has very much come down from
the level of either of the other versions. The boastful speech to
the keepers is not at all in the style of Helias, and it is a poor
substitute either for the dignified offer and defiance in Orderic
or for the lively dialogue in William of Malmesbury. This last
we should gladly have had in Wace’s version, as there would have
been some faint chance of recovering a scrap or two more of the
original French to match the “Dans quens,” which has a genuine
ring on the one hand, as the “magister” and the “nebulo” of
William of Malmesbury have on the other.</p>

<p class="p2">Geoffrey Gaimar too (Chroniques Anglo-Normandes, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 37) has
a version in which Helias, when a prisoner, makes a boastful
speech to the effect that, if it had not been by an ambush, he would
never have been taken;</p>

<p class="unindent">He is brought before the King, to whom he says that he is much
beloved in his land, and that, if he were only able to assemble

castles of the country;</p>

<p class="unindent">I need hardly stop to show how utterly unhistorical all this is.
But the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“bel amur,”</span> the challenge, the release of the Count and
the surrender of the city and the castles, the general looking on
war as a kind of game, are all highly characteristic of the chivalrous
King. The last words indeed give us the other side of chivalry;
but I confess that they seem to me to be unfair to William Rufus,
however well they might suit Robert of Bellême. Geoffrey Gaimar
lived to see times when the doings of Robert of Bellême, exceptional
in his own day, had become the general rule.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Voyage of William Rufus to Touques.</p>

<p><span class="sc">This</span> story is told by a great many writers; but, as in the story
of the interview of William Rufus and Helias, our two main versions
are those of Orderic (775 A) and of William of Malmesbury (iv.
320). And, as in the case of that story, with which William of
Malmesbury couples it, he tells it simply as an illustrative anecdote,
while with Orderic it is part of his regular narrative. And again
William throws one of the speeches into the form of a familiar
classical quotation, and the curious apology quoted in the last
note is made to apply to this story as well as to the other.
At the same time there is no actual contradiction between
the two versions. The messenger&mdash;&#8203;Amalchis according to Orderic&mdash;&#8203;reaches
England and finds the King in the New Forest.
He thus (775 A) describes the delivery of the message; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ille
mari transfretato Clarendonam venit, regi cum familiaribus suis</span>
<a name="Page_646" id="Page_646"></a><span class="pageno">646</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in Novam Forestam equitanti obviavit, et alacriter inquirenti rumores,
respondit, Cœnomannis per proditionem surrepta est. Verum
dominus meus Balaonem custodit, et regalis familia omnes munitiones
sibi assignatas sollerter observavit, auxiliumque regalis potentiæ
vehementer desiderat, in hostile robur quod eos undique
includit et impugnat.”</span> William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 320) does not
mention the place; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Venationi in quadam silva intentum nuntius
detinuit ex transmarinis partibus, obsessam esse civitatem Cinomannis,
quam nuper fratre profecto suæ potestati adjecerat.”</span> This
is a somewhat inadequate summary of the Cenomannian war.</p>

<p>Now comes the King’s answer, in which I have ventured in the
text to bring in both the speeches which are attributed to Rufus on
first hearing the news of the loss of Le Mans. In Orderic the story
stands thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“His auditis, rex dixit, ‘Eamus trans mare, nostros adjuvare.
Eodem momento inconsultis omnibus equum habenis regiravit, ipsumque
calcaribus urgens ad pontum festinavit, et in quandam
vetustam navim quam forte invenit, sine regio apparatu velut
plebeius intravit et remigare protinus imperavit. Sic nimirum nec
congruentem flatum nec socios nec alia quæ regiam dignitatem
decebant exspectavit; sed omnis metus expers fortunæ et pelago
sese commisit, et sequenti luce ad portum Tolchæ, Deo duce, salvus
applicuit.’”</p>

<p>He then goes on with the graphic details of the landing at
Touques and the ride to Bonneville, which find no place in William
of Malmesbury. William’s version is as follows;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Statim ergo ut expeditus erat retorsit equum, iter ad mare convertens.
Admonentibus ducibus exercitum advocandum, paratos
componendos, ‘Videbo,’ ait, ‘quis me sequetur; putatis me non
habiturum homines? si cognovi juventutem meam, etiam naufragio
ad me venisse volet.’ Hoc igitur modo pene solus ad mare pervenit.
Erat tunc nubilus aer et ventus contrarius; flatus violentia terga
maris verrebat. Illum statim transfretare volentem nautæ exorant
ut pacem pelagi et ventorum clementiam operiatur. ‘Atqui,’ inquit
rex, ‘numquam audivi regem naufragio interiisse.’ Quin potius
solvite retinacula navium, videbitis elementa jam conspirata in
meum obsequium. Ponto transito, obsessores, ejus audita fama,
dissiliunt.”</p>

<p>Then follows the interview with Helias, quite out of place.
<a name="Page_647" id="Page_647"></a><span class="pageno">647</span></p>

<p>Here we have several separate details in each version; but they
quite fit into one another. Of Rufus’ two speeches before he rides
off, each seems to need the support of the other. The speech to
the sailors lurks as it were in the words of Orderic, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“remigare protinus
imperavit,”</span> and his other words, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“fortunæ et pelago sese
commisit,”</span> suggest the same general idea which comes out in them.
They suggest the well-known story of Cæsar which William of
Malmesbury seems to have in his head, which is told by Florus
(<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 37), Appian (<abbr title="Bellum Civile two">Bell. Civ. ii.</abbr> 57), and Plutarch (Cæsar, 38). The
Latin writer says only <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quid times? Caesarem vehis?”</span> while the two
Greek writers bring in the word <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="tychê">τύχη</span>
(<span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title="Ithi, gennaie, tolma kai dedithi
mêden. Kaisara phereis kai tên Kaisaros tychên sympleousan">Ἴθι, γενναῖε, τόλμα καὶ δέδιθι μηδέν.
Καίσαρα φέρεις καὶ τὴν Καίσαρος τύχην συμπλέουσαν</span>). Our
writers are not likely to have read either of the Greek books, and
there is enough about “Fortuna” in the passage of Lucan (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr>
577&ndash;593) which William of Malmesbury at least must have had in
his eye, and where the few words of Appian and the fewer of Florus
grow into a speech of many lines. The odd thing however is that
the actual words do not seem to come from anything in Lucan, but
to be in a manner made up out of two passages of Claudian. We
get the sentiment in one (De III <abbr title="Consulatu Honorii">Cons. Hon.</abbr> 96);</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="i0a">“O nimium dilecte Deo, cui fundit ab antris</div>
<div class="i0">Æolus armatas hiemes, cui militat æther,</div>
<div class="i0">Et conjurati veniunt ad classica venti.”</div>
</div>

<p>But the actual words come nearer to the other (De IV <abbr title="Consulatu Honorii">Cons. Hon.</abbr>
284);</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="i0a">“Nonne vides, operum quo se pulcherrimus ille</div>
<div class="i0">Mundus amore ligat, nec vi connexa per ævum</div>
<div class="i0">Conspirant elementa sibi?”</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Just as in the other story, we may suppose that Rufus said something
which, in the course of improving into Latin, suggested the
words of the two Latin poets. The saying that he had never heard
of a king being drowned surely has the genuine stamp of the Red
King about it. And it is to be remembered that there is a passage
which evidently refers to the same story in a grave contemporary,
who takes his quotations, not from heathen poets but from the New
Testament. Eadmer (54) attributes to William Rufus, as a general
privilege, something like what in our own day we have been used
to call “Queen’s weather;”</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648"></a><span class="pageno">648</span>
“Ventus insuper et ipsum mare videbantur ei obtemperare.
Verum dico, non mentior, quia quum de Anglia in Normanniam
transire vel inde cursum prout ipsum voluntas sua ferebat, redire
volebat, mox, illo adveniente, et mari appropinquante, omnis tempestas,
quæ nonnunquam immane sæviebat, sedabatur, et transeunti
mira tranquillitate famulabatur.”</p>

<p>It is worth notice that the same idea is found, besides Lucan and
Claudian, in a third Latin writer, who is much less likely to have
been known to either Orderic or William of Malmesbury. This is
in the Panegyric addressed by Eumenius to the elder Constantius
(Pan. Vet. <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 14). He is describing the voyage of Constantius to
Britain to put down Allectus, when, as in the cases of Cæsar and
William Rufus, the weather was bad;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quis enim se, quamlibet iniquo mari, non auderet credere, te
navigante? Omnium, ut dicitur, accepto nuntio navigationis tuæ,
una vox et hortatio fuit; ‘Quid dubitamus? quid moramur? Ipse
jam solvit, jam provehitur, jam fortasse pervenit. Experiamur
omnia, per quoscumque fluctus eamus. Quid est, quod timere
possimus? Cæsarem sequimur.’”</p>

<p>Eumenius of course had the story of the earlier Cæsar in his
mind.</p>

<p>In all these versions the saying of William Rufus seems to be
quoted as an instance of his pride and irreverence. Matthew Paris
alone (<abbr title="Historia Anglorum">Hist. Angl.</abbr> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 166) gives his speech an unexpectedly pious
turn. To the shipman, who addresses him as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“hominum audacissime”</span>
and asks <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“numquid tu ventis et mari poteris imperare?”</span> he answers,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Non frequenter</span> [no longer “never” but “hardly ever”] <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">auditum
est, reges Christianos Deum invocantes fluctibus fuisse submersos.
Aliqui de oppressis et obsessis apud Cenomannem orant pro me, quos
Deus, etsi non me, clementer exaudiet.”</span> Matthew also makes the
news be brought to the King, not when he is hunting, but when he
is at a feast.</p>

<p class="p2">The story is found, in one shape or another, in all the riming
chronicles. Wace (14908), who tells the whole story of Helias’
entry into Le Mans with great spirit, but utterly out of place,
gives a vivid picture of the coming of the messenger;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“En Engleterre esteit li reis,</div>
<div class="i0">Mult out Normanz, mult out Engleis;</div>
<div class="i0">Brachez aveit fet demander,</div>
<div class="i0">En boiz voloit aler berser.</div>
<a name="Page_649" id="Page_649"></a><span class="pageno">649</span>

<div class="i0">La cité a Helies prise,</div>
<div class="i0">E la tor ad entor assise;</div>
<div class="i0">Normanz ki dedenz sa defendent.”</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The passage in its general effect, and to some extent in its actual
words, recalls the better known description (10983; <abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume three">N. C. vol. iii.
p.</abbr> 258) of the news of Eadward’s death and Harold’s election being
brought to William the Great. It is perhaps to make the two
scenes more completely tally that Rufus, who, in Orderic and
William of Malmesbury, is already engaged in hunting, is in this
version merely going out to hunt. Of his father it was said;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Mult aveit od li chevaliers</div>
<div class="i0">E dameisels et esquiers.”</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">But the son,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Mult out <em>Normanz</em>, mult out <em>Engleis</em>.”</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">This reminds us of the other passage (see above, <a href="#Page_533"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 533</a>) where “Normans”
and “English” are made to help the fallen Rufus before Saint
Michael’s Mount. And the question again presents itself; What
did Wace exactly mean by Normans and English? We must remember
his position. Wace was a writer locally Norman, the
chronicler of the Norman Conquest, writing when, in England
itself, the distinction of races had nearly died out. His way of
thinking and speaking, as that of one accustomed to past times,
would most likely be different both from that of the time of which
he is writing and from that which would be familiar to either
Normans or English&mdash;&#8203;whether <em>genere</em> or <em>natione</em>&mdash;in his own time.
In Rufus’ day “Normanz et Engleiz” would have meant “Normanni
et Angli <em>genere</em>;” but it is not likely that many “Angli
<em>genere</em>” would be in the immediate company of the King. In
Wace’s own day, “Normanz et Engleiz” already meant “Normanni
et Angli <em>natione</em>;” only there would hardly have been any occasion
for using the phrase. Wace very likely used the phrase in a slightly
different sense in the two passages. Before the Mount, in describing
a warlike exploit, he most likely meant simply Norman and English
<em>natione</em>. In the present passage his mind perhaps floated between
the two meanings.</p>

<p>The King hears the news brought by the sergeant; he gives up
<a name="Page_650" id="Page_650"></a><span class="pageno">650</span>
his purpose of hunting that day, and swears his usual oath by the
face of Lucca that those who have done him this damage shall pay
for it;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Li reis mua tot son corage</div>
<div class="i0">Dès ke il oï li message.</div>
<div class="i0">Li vo de Luche en a juré</div>
<div class="i0">Ke mult sera chier comperé.</div>
<div class="i0">Cest serement aveit en us,</div>
<div class="i0">Ne faiseit nul serement plus.”</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">He bids the messenger to cross the sea as fast as he can, to go to
Le Mans and to tell his forces there that by God’s help he will be
there to help them in eight days;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“D’ore en wit jors el Mans serai,</div>
<div class="i0">Dunc se Dex plaist les secorrai.”</div>
</div>

<p>He then&mdash;&#8203;being in England, it must be remembered&mdash;&#8203;asks the
nearest way to Le Mans. On the direct line which is shown him,
there is a well-built house. He says that he will not for a hundred
marks of silver turn a hundred feet out of the way. So he has the
house pulled down, and rides over the site to Southampton&mdash;&#8203;not
alone, in this version, but with a following;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Une maiziere li mostrerent,</div>
<div class="i0">Ço distrent ke il Mans ert là,</div>
<div class="i0">E ço dist ke par la ira;</div>
<div class="i0">Por cenz mars d’argent, ço diseit,</div>
<div class="i0">Del Mans cenz piez n’esluingnereit</div>
<div class="i0">De là, ù il ses piez teneit,</div>
<div class="i0">Quant li besuing del Mans oeit,</div>
<div class="i0">Dunc fist abatre la maiziere,</div>
<div class="i0">Ki mult esteit bone et entiere;</div>
<div class="i0">La maiziere fu abatue</div>
<div class="i0">E fete fu si grant l’issue</div>
<div class="i0">Ke li Reis Ros è li vassal</div>
<div class="i0">I passerent tuit à cheval.”</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Absurd as this story is, and utterly irreconcileable with the earlier
versions, there is still a ring of William Rufus about it. And we
may safely accept Southampton as the haven from which he set out.
But the zeal for taking the straightest road which was so strong on
him by land seems to have passed away by sea, as he goes not to
Touques but to Barfleur, certainly not the nearest point for getting
from Southampton to Le Mans. The story of the voyage is told in
much the same way as in William of Malmesbury, the speech to
the sailors standing thus;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Unkes, dist-il, n’oï parler</div>
<div class="i0">De Rei ki fu néié en mer;</div>
<div class="i0">Fetes vos nés el parfont traire,</div>
<div class="i0">Essaïez ke porreiz faire.”</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Geoffrey Gaimar (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chroniques Anglo-Normandes</span>, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 32) makes the
messenger bring a letter, which the King seemingly gives to Randolf
Flambard to read;
<a name="Page_651" id="Page_651"></a><span class="pageno">651</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“‘Tenez cest bref, sire reis.’</div>
<div class="i0">Li reis le prist, tost le fruissat,</div>
<div class="i0">Ranulf Flambard le bref baillat.”</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">He sends the messenger back with a letter; he rides to Southampton,
orders a force to be got together to follow him, and himself crosses
with a company of twelve hundred rich knights. Otherwise the
tale is essentially the same. But it is worth noticing that Geoffrey,
when he gets among sea-faring folk, uses two English words (the
steersman we have already met with in his English garb in Domesday;
see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 763);</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="unindent">This writer does not mention Southampton, Touques, Barfleur, or
any particular port.</p>

<p class="p2">The doctrine that kings were never drowned might seem to be
contradicted by the popular interpretation of the fate of the Pharaoh
of Exodus. But the text certainly does not imply that the Pharaoh
himself was drowned. On the other hand, there is somewhere the
story of an Irish king who, setting out with his fleet, was met by
Noah’s flood&mdash;&#8203;conceived seemingly as something like the bore in
the Severn&mdash;&#8203;and was drowned.
<a name="Page_652" id="Page_652"></a><span class="pageno">652</span></p>

<p>It is worth while comparing this story of William Rufus with
the behaviour of our next king of the same name in a case somewhat
like this, when he too was sailing from England to the land
of his birth. When William the Third was in danger in an open
boat off the isle of Goree, we read (Macaulay, <abbr title="History or England four">Hist. Eng. iv.</abbr> 2);</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The hardiest mariners showed signs of uneasiness. But William,
through the whole night, was as composed as if he had been in the
drawing-room at Kensington. ‘For shame,’ he said to one of the
dismayed sailors: ‘are you afraid to die in my company?’”</p>

<p>The difference between the two speeches is characteristic. But
the parallel of Cæsar was seized on in both cases. Among the
pageants when William entered the Hague (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 5), when the events
of his own life were represented, this scene was shown;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“There, too, was a boat amidst the ice and the breakers; and
above it was most appropriately inscribed, in the majestic language
of Rome, the saying of the great Roman, ‘What dost thou fear?
Thou hast Cæsar on board.’”</p>

<p class="center sc">The Siege of Mayet.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I visited</span> Mayet with Mr. Fowler and Mr. Parker in July, 1879,
when we examined many other of the castles and sites of castles in
that neighbourhood. But we could not pitch on the actual site of
the siege of Mayet with the same confidence with which we fixed
most of the sites of our present story. The evidence is by no
means so clear as it is in the case of most of the Cenomannian
towns and fortresses. There are in truth too many sites to choose
from.</p>

<p>The small town of Mayet is not rich in antiquities. Its ancient
church has been, first desecrated, and then swept away. Nor is the
town itself immediately commanded by any fortress, like those of
Fresnay, Beaumont, and Ballon. But two spots lie to the east of
the town which cannot fail to have had some share in our history.
A large house of the <i>Renaissance</i>, with portions of an earlier castle
worked into it, stands at the foot of a low hill at some distance
from the town, and with a good deal of swampy ground lying
<a name="Page_653" id="Page_653"></a><span class="pageno">653</span>
between them. This boasts itself to be the site of the fortress
where the second Cenomannian expedition of William the Red
came to so strange and lame an ending. But there are no traces
of eleventh-century work remaining, and the site itself is most
unlike the site of an eleventh-century fortress. The hill immediately
above the house, far lower than Ballon or any of its fellows,
does make some feeble approach to the favourite peninsular shape,
and fancy at least has traced, amid the havoc made by the plough,
some faint signs of ditches and made ground. On the high ground
on the other side of the swamp, less completely cut off from the town,
rises a mound, of whose artificial construction and military purpose
there can be no doubt, and where ancient objects of various kinds are
said to have been found. But this mound seems far too small to
have been the site of such a stronghold as the castle of Mayet appears
in our story. Could we believe it to have been thrown up during
William’s siege, as a besieging mound, like those of which we have
so often heard, its interest as regards our story would be almost as
great as if it were the site of the head castle itself. But it seems
too far off for any purpose save that of keeping the garrison in
check; if the besieged castle stood on the opposite hill or at its
foot, the stress of the siege must have taken place at some point
much nearer to its site. The siege of Mayet is so singular a story,
and so important in the history of this war, that it is disappointing
not to be able to fix its topography with any confidence. But it is
unluckily true that he who traces out the siege of Mayet cannot do
so with the same full assurance that he is treading the true historic
ground which he feels at Ballon and Fresnay.</p>

<p class="p2">In the details of the siege I have strictly followed Orderic, save
that I have ventured to bring in the very characteristic story of
Robert of Bellême which is told by Wace. But it cannot well
have had the effect which Wace (15074) attributes to it, that of
causing the army to disperse, and so making the King raise the
siege;</p>

<p><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654"></a><span class="pageno">654</span>
The order of events in Wace is really wonderful. After Robert
has gone to the East, William Rufus reigns in peace, seemingly
over Maine as well as Normandy. Helias seizes Le Mans; the
news is brought to William; he sails to Barfleur; he recovers
Le Mans (having on his road the singular adventure described in
14998 of Pluquet’s text, 9899 of Andresen’s); he besieges Mayet; he
returns to Le Mans; he ravages the land; Helias is taken prisoner;
he is brought before the King and released, and then William goes
back to England to be shot by Walter Tirel.</p>

<p class="center sc">William Rufus and the Towers of Le Mans Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Was</span> the bidding of William Rufus actually carried out in this
matter? Did Bishop Hildebert pull down the towers or not?
Unluckily Orderic tells us nothing about the story, and the
language of the Biographer seems to me to be purposely obscure.</p>

<p>Hildebert himself mentions the matter in a passage which I
quoted in the text (<a href="#Page_298"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 298</a>), in which he complains of the horrors of
a voyage to England. He says (Duchèsne, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 248);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Longum est enarrare quam constanti tyrannide rex Anglicus
in nos sævierit, qui, temperantia regis abjecta, decreverit non
prius pontifici parendum quam pontificem compelleret in sacrilegium.
Quia etenim turres ecclesiæ nostræ dejicere nolumus,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>One can make no certain inference from this, except that
Hildebert was not disposed to pull down the towers when he wrote
the letter, seemingly in England. The Biographer is fuller. I
have quoted (see <a href="#Page_298"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 298</a>) the passages which describe the commands
and offers of Rufus; we then read;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Verumtamen Hildebertus magnis undique coartabatur angustiis,
quia sibi et de regis offensione periculum, et de turris destructione
sibi et ecclesiæ suæ imminere grande prævidebat opprobrium:
propter quod a rege dilationem petebat, donec super his consilium
accepisset. Qua vix impetrata, cernens sibi nequaquam esse utile
in illis regionibus diutius immorari, breviter ad suam reversus
est ecclesiam…. Interea præsul de præcepto regis vehementer
anxius, de urbis incendio, de domorum et omnium rerum suarum
<a name="Page_655" id="Page_655"></a><span class="pageno">655</span>
destructione, de civium expulsione; primo tamen de clericorum,
quos violentia regis ab urbe eliminaverat, dispersione, mæstissimus,
Dei omnipotentis clementiam jugiter precabatur, ut ab ecclesia
et populo sibi commisso iram indignationis suæ dignaretur
avertere.”</p>

<p>He then goes on to tell how wonderfully God saved them all
by the sudden death of Rufus and the final coming of Helias. But
he does not directly say whether the towers were pulled down or
not. His way of telling the story might suggest the thought
that the towers were pulled down, but that he did not like to
say so.</p>

<p>To my mind the appearances of the building look the same way.
We have seen that the towers of Howel were clearly at the ends
of the transepts. Of the single tower now standing at the end
of the south transept, the lower part is of the twelfth century;
most likely the work of William of Passavant (see above, <a href="#Page_636"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 636</a>).
The ruined building at the end of the other transept has columns
and capitals of a much earlier character, agreeing with the work of
Howel. A base of the same early kind as the single pair of piers
spoken of in the nave (see above, <a href="#Page_638"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 638</a>) may be the work of
Howel; it may be either a relic of Arnold’s foundations or a
scrap of something much earlier. It has been objected that this
ruined building does not seem to have been a tower. And I
must allow that it must have been a tower of a somewhat unusual
kind. But the appearances are quite consistent with the notion of
a transept with aisles, and with its main body ending in an <i>engaged</i>
tower.</p>

<p>If these ruins are not the remains of one of Howel’s towers,
his towers must have stood nearer to the body of the church than the
existing southern tower stands, and the ruins to the north-west must
belong to the episcopal palace or some other building. If this be
so, something of the interest of the place is lost, but the argument
seems almost stronger. It would have been nothing wonderful
if the later rebuilding of the transepts had swept away all
trace of the work of the eleventh and twelfth century, so that
the fabric should in no way show whether any Romanesque towers
were ever pulled down or ever built. But it is not so. We see
that a late Romanesque tower was built to replace one of the
towers of Howel, while the other, according to this view, has
<a name="Page_656" id="Page_656"></a><span class="pageno">656</span>
vanished without trace or successor. This would seem to point
even more strongly than the other view to the belief that two
towers were built, that both were pulled down, that afterwards
one was rebuilt and the other not.</p>

<p class="p2">It is the business of the topographer of Le Mans rather than
of the historian of William Rufus to settle what the remains at
the end of the north transept are, if they are not the remains of
Howel’s tower. But it may be noticed that Howel was a considerable
builder or restorer in the adjoining palace (Vet. An. 298),
and that the palace itself had a tower hard by the church.
William of Passavant (Vet. An. 373) made certain arrangements
about the three chapels of the palace&mdash;&#8203;Saint David’s itself has only
two&mdash;&#8203;one of which is described as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“tertia altior, quæ in turri
sita ecclesiam cathedralem vicinius speculabatur.”</span> In any case
this group of buildings and ruins at the north-east corner of Saint
Julian’s is one of the most striking to be found anywhere. There
are these puzzling fragments of the days of the counts and bishops
of our story; there is the mighty eastern limb of the present church,
begun when Maine had passed away from all fellowship with Normandy
and England, when Le Mans was the city of a Countess,
widow of Richard, vassal of Philip. There is the northern transept,
begun when Maine and Normandy were wholly swallowed up by
France, finished at the very moment when Maine had again an
English lord (Recherches, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 122). And earlier than all, there is
the Roman wall which the vast choir has overleaped, but which
still remains outside the church. And, as if to bring together the
earliest and the latest times, one of its bastions is strangely
mixed up with work of an almost English character, which seems
plainly to proclaim itself as belonging to the reign of Henry, Sixth
of England and Second of France. Truly, setting aside exceptional
spots like Rome and Athens, like Spalato and Trier and Ravenna,
no city of Christendom is fuller of lessons, alike in art and in
history, than the city of Helias, the birth-place of Henry Fitz-Empress.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Death of William Rufus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> briefly compared the chief versions of the death of
William Rufus, and the writers from whom they come, in Appendix
U. in the fifth volume of the Norman Conquest. I will now go
somewhat more fully into the matter.</p>

<p>I still hold, as I held then, that no absolute certainty can be
come to as to the actor, intentional or otherwise, in the King’s
death. Our only sure statement is to be found in the vague and
dark words of the Chronicle, which look most like an intentional
murder, but which do not absolutely imply it. If Rufus was
murdered, it is hopeless to seek for any record of his murderer.
We may guess for ever, and that is all. At any rate there can be no
ground for fastening a charge of murder on Walter Tirel; for, if
we except the dark hint in Geoffrey Gaimar (see <a href="#Page_325"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 325</a>), all those
who make him the doer of the deed make it a deed done by
accident. And the consent in favour of the belief that Rufus died
by an accidental shot of Walter Tirel is very general and very
weighty. It is the account of all our highest authorities, except
the very highest of all. And even with the version of the Chronicle
it does not stand in any literal contradiction. We have to set
against it Walter’s own weighty denial (see below, <a href="#Page_674"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 674</a>), and the
fact that there were other versions which named other persons. We
have also to set against it the circumstance that, if Rufus did die
by any conspiracy, never mind on whose part, it was obviously
convenient to encourage belief in such a story as the received one.
(See <a href="#Page_326"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 326</a>.) If there were anywhere English or Norman murderers,
nothing could better serve their purpose, or the purpose
of any who encouraged or sheltered them, than to attribute the
deed to one who was French rather than either English or Norman,
and to describe it as accidental on his part. And if, as one can
hardly doubt, Walter Tirel was known to have been in the King’s
near company on the day of his death, he was an obvious person
to pick out for the character of the accidental slayer.</p>

<p>I can therefore do nothing but leave the doubtful story to the
judgement of the reader. To that end I have given a summary
<a name="Page_658" id="Page_658"></a><span class="pageno">658</span>
of the chief versions in the text. The account of the early part
of the day, as given by William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 333), which
I have followed in <a href="#Page_327"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 327</a>, fits in perfectly well with the account in
Orderic (782 A), which begins only after dinner. Nor is there
any difference, except in details of no importance, between the
accounts of the King’s actual death as given by William and by
Orderic (see <a href="#Page_333"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 333</a>). In both the King dies by a chance shot of
Walter’s, but William makes the King and Walter shoot at two
different stags, while in Orderic’s version they both shoot at the
same stag. It is from William of Malmesbury that we get the
graphic detail of the King sheltering his eyes from the sun’s rays.
His whole account stands thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Jam Phœbo in oceanum proclivi, rex cervo ante se transeunti,
extento nervo et emissa sagitta, non adeo sævum vulnus inflixit;
diutile adhuc fugitantem vivacitate oculorum prosecutus, opposita
contra violentiam solarium radiorum manu. Tunc Walterius
pulcrum facinus animo parturiens, ut, rege alias interim intento,
ipse alterum cervum qui forte propter transibat prosterneret,
inscius et impotens regium pectus (Deus bone!) lethali arundine
trajecit. Saucius ille nullum verbum emisit; sed ligno sagittæ
quantum extra corpus extabat effracto, moxque supra vulnus cadens,
mortem acceleravit. Accurrit Walterius; sed, quia nec sensum nec
vocem hausit, perniciter cornipedem insiliens, beneficio calcarium
probe evasit.”</p>

<p>Orderic is shorter;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cum rex et Gualterius de Pice cum paucis sodalibus in nemore
constituti essent, et armati prædam avide expectarent, subiter
inter eos currente fera, rex de statu suo recessit, et Gualterius
sagittam emisit. Quæ super dorsum feræ setam radens rapide
volavit, atque regem e regione stantem lethaliter vulneravit. Qui
mox ad terram cecidit, et sine mora, proh dolor! expiravit.”</p>

<p>Florence really adds nothing to the account in the Chronicle,
except so far that he adds the name of Walter Tirel. He brings
in the event with some chronological pomp, but he cuts the
actual death of the King short. He is in a moralizing fit, and
takes up his parable at much greater length than is usual
with him;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Deinde <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> non. Augusti, feria <abbr title="five">v.</abbr>, indictione <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr>, rex Anglorum
Willelmus junior, dum in Nova Foresta, quæ lingua Anglorum

Ytene nuncupatur, venatu esset occupatus, a quodam Franco,
Waltero cognomento Tirello, sagitta incaute directa percussus,
vitam finivit, et Wintoniam delatus, in veteri monasterio, in ecclesia
S. Petri est tumulatus. Nec mirum, ut populi rumor affirmat,
hanc proculdubio magnam Dei virtutem esse et vindictam.”</p>

<p>He then goes on with a great deal of matter, much of which
I have referred to in various places. He speaks of the making
of the New Forest, of the death of young Richard, the natural
phænomena of the reign, the recent appearances of the devil, and
the iniquities of Randolf Flambard. It is here that he notices
(see <a href="#Page_335"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 335</a>) that a church had once stood on the spot where the
King died. Henry of Huntingdon too brings in the event with
some stateliness, as the last act of a great drama. But he gives
no special details, beyond bringing in, like Orderic, Florence, and
William, the name of Walter Tirel;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Millesimo centesimo anno, rex Willelmus xiii. regni sui anno,
vitam crudelem misero fine terminavit. Namque cum gloriose et
patrio honore curiam tenuisset ad Natale apud Glouecestre, ad
Pascha apud Wincestre, ad Pentecosten apud Londoniam, ivit
venatum in Novo foresto in crastino kalendas Augusti, ubi
Walterus Tyrel cum sagitta cervo intendens, regem percussit
inscius. Rex corde ictus corruit, nec verbum edidit.”</p>

<p>He then goes on to describe at length the evils of the reign,
partly in his own words, partly in those of the Chronicle, and
records what followed in a kind of breathless haste, keeping the
Chronicle before him, but giving things a turn of his own;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sepultus est in crastino perditionis suæ apud Wincestre, et
Henricus ibidem in regem electus, dedit episcopatum Wincestriæ
Willelmo Giffard, pergensque Londoniam sacratus est ibi a Mauricio
Londoniensi episcopo, melioratione legum et consuetudinum optabili
repromissa.”</p>

<p>The object of piling facts on one another in this fashion is to
bring the record of Henry’s promised reforms as near as may be
to the picture of the evil doings of Rufus.</p>

<p>By the time that Wace wrote, there were several stories to be
chosen from. The King gives arrows to his companions, and
specially to Walter Tirel. They go out to hunt in the morning,
contrary to the accounts both of Orderic and of William of Malmesbury
(15164 Pluquet, 10069 Andresen);</p>

<a name="Page_660" id="Page_660"></a><span class="pageno">660</span>

</div>

<p>He distinctly says that he does not know who shot the arrow, but
that it was commonly said to be Walter Tirel, with some of the
variations in detail which we have already seen, as for instance
whether the arrow glanced from a tree or not;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Ne sai qui traist ne qui laissa,</div>

</div>

<p>The other French rimers are this time, though certainly less
trustworthy than Wace, of more importance in one way, as showing
that there was in some quarters, as there well might be in Normandy,
a more charitable feeling towards the Red King than we
find in the English writers. I have given in the text the substance
of the accounts of Geoffrey Gaimar and Benoît de Sainte-More.
The version of Geoffrey Gaimar (Chroniques Anglo-Normandes, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>
54) I do not remember to have ever seen referred to, except in
<abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Michel’s note to Benoît. It is so curious in its details that it is
worth giving at length. It is absolutely impossible to believe it
in the teeth of opposite statements of so much higher authority,
yet it is strange if all its graphic touches are a mere play of
fancy;</p>

<p>Geoffrey, it should be noticed, has nothing to say about dreams
and warnings; the <em>gab</em> between the King and Walter Tirel seems
in his version to take their place (see <a href="#Page_322"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 322</a>). But in the other
account which deals kindly with Rufus, that of Benoît de Sainte-More
(see <a href="#Page_332"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 332</a>), the warning dream, in this case assigned to the
King himself, plays an important part. So also does Gundulf,
the expounder of the dream. His presence is thus explained
(40523);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Veirs est e chose coneue</div>
<div class="i0">C’une haors avoit eue</div>

<div class="i0">Out mult Nostre-Seignor preié</div>
<div class="i0">Que de cele grant mesestance</div>
<div class="i0">Eust e cure e remembrance.”</div>
</div>

<p>We may note that Anselm, not yet canonized, is already called
<em>saint</em> in a formal way.</p>

<p>The King is to hunt the next day in the New Forest; in the
night he has the dream, which is told with a singular variation.
He first sees the dead body of a stag on the altar; then it changes
into that of a man (40560);</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Quant il regardout sor l’autel,</div>
<div class="i0">Si i veeit, ce li ert vis,</div>
<div class="i0">Un mult grant cerf qui ert ocis,</div>
<div class="i0">Por eschiver le grant renei</div>
<div class="i0">Que il voleit faire de sei,</div>
<div class="i0">Alout e si ’n voleit manger;</div>

<div class="i0">Si li ert vis s’ert bien certain,</div>
<div class="i0">Que c’ert cors d’ome apertement</div>
<div class="i0">Ocis e nafré et sanglent.”</div>
</div>

<p>Gundulf, “li evesques, li sainz hom,” then preaches a sermon
of some length, which the King listens to with unexpected docility;
he promises amendment of life, and receives absolution;
<a name="Page_662" id="Page_662"></a><span class="pageno">662</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Simple e od bone volunté</div>

<div class="i0">Bien sont e conut la raison</div>

<div class="i0">Tote sa male volonté</div>
<div class="i0">Quant sa grace out e son congé.</div>
<div class="i0">Mult s’en torna joios e lié.”</div>
</div>

<p>In this version there is no special mention of Anselm and the
synod; the exhortation of Gundulf is quite general. In the account
given by Giraldus (De <abbr title="instructione principum page">Inst. Prin. p.</abbr> 174)&mdash;who, it must be borne
in mind, has two dreams, one dreamed by the King, and another
by a premature canon of Dunstable&mdash;&#8203;this is strongly brought out.
The bishop, whose name is not given, exhorts the King at much
less length than Gundulf does in the rimes of Benoît, and the
promise of reformation stands thus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cum episcopus consilium ei daret quatenus, convocatis illico
episcopis regni sui et clero universo, eorundem consilio se Domino
per omnia conciliaret, missisque statim nuntiis venerabilem sanctumque
virum Anselmum Cantuariensem archiepiscopum, quem
ea tempestate, quod libertates ecclesiæ tueri volebat, exulare compulerat,
ab exilio revocaret, respondens rex se cum regni sui proceribus
consilium inde in brevi habiturum.”</p>

<p>In Benoît’s version the King’s companions now urge him to
go out to hunt. The description is very graphic;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“E si vaslet furent hoesé</div>
<div class="i0">E en lor chaceors munté,</div>
<div class="i0">Les arcs ès mains, gamiz e presz,</div>
<div class="i0">E detrès eus lor bons brachez;</div>
<div class="i0">Abaient chens e sonent corns,</div>
<div class="i0">Monté atendent le rei fors.”</div>
</div>

<p>He refuses for a while, and sets forth his troubled mind with some
pathos;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Avoi! fait-il, seignors, avoi!</div>
<div class="i0">Uncor sui-je plus maus assez</div>
<div class="i0">E plus cent tant que vos ne quidez;</div>
<div class="i0">Mais c’est la fin, remis m’en sui,</div>
<div class="i0">Que je n’irai mais en bois ui.</div>
<div class="i0">Ne voil por rien qu’alé i seie</div>
<div class="i0">Ne que jamais la forest veie.”</div>
</div>

<p>He goes forth, and, as I have said in the text (<a href="#Page_332"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 332</a>), is shot
by the arrow glancing from a tree. Benoît knew through what
agency;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Mais tant li mostre li reis Ros</div>
<div class="i0">Que c’il r’a d’aïr entesée</div>
<div class="i0">Une sajette barbelée,</div>
<div class="i0">E deiables tant l’a conveié[e]</div>
<div class="i0">Qu’à un gros raim fiert e glaceie.</div>
<div class="i0">Le rei feri delez le quor.”</div>
</div>

<p>His speech to his accidental slayer is most pious;
<a name="Page_663" id="Page_663"></a><span class="pageno">663</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Va-t’en, fui-tei senz demorer,</div>
<div class="i0">Kar mort m’as par ma grant enfance.</div>
<div class="i0">Ci a Deus pris de mei venjance:</div>
<div class="i0">Or li cri merci e soplei</div>
<div class="i0">Qu’il ait oi merci de mei</div>
<div class="i0">Par sa sainte chere douçor,</div>
<div class="i0">Kar mult sui vers lui peccheor.”</div>
</div>

<p>In the earlier of Giraldus’ two stories, one which has much in
common with this of Benoît, the arrow strikes the King accidentally,
but there is nothing about its glancing from a tree. As he looks on
William Rufus as the maker of the New Forest, he describes his
going forth to hunt there with some solemnity;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Protinus contra dissuasionem in prædictam forestam, ubi tot
ecclesias destituerat, totosque fideles qui glebæ ibidem ab antiquo
ascripti fuerant immisericorditer exheredaverat, venatum ivit. Nec
mora, soluta per interemptionem contentione ubi deliquit, casuali
cujusdam suorum ictu sagittæ letaliter percussus decubuit; miles
enim directo in feram telo, nutu divino cælum pariter et telum
regente, non feram eo sed ferum et absque modo ferocem, transpenetravit.”</span>
(<abbr title="Compare">Cf.</abbr> the extracts in <a href="#Page_337"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 337</a>.)</p>

<p>Having got thus far, pretty nearly in Benoît’s company, Giraldus
goes on to tell his other story which brings in the Prior of Dunstable.
But Dunstable, in its own Annals, did not claim an earlier
founder than Henry the First. We are therefore left to guess as
to the origin of a story which speaks of the priory of Dunstable as
already existing in the time of Rufus, and even as enjoying exceptional
favour at his hands. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“miles quidam”</span> of the former
story here becomes Ralph of Aix, who is brought in after much the
same fashion in which Walter Tirel is in those versions of the story
which mention him.</p>

<p class="p2">These are the chief varieties in the story of the death of Rufus;
but the tale is so famous, it has taken such a hold on popular
imagination from that day to our own, that it may be well to do
as we have done in some earlier cases, and to trace some of the
forms which the story took in the hands of writers of later times.</p>

<p>The Hyde writer (302), who always has notions of his own about
all matters, has nothing special to tell us about the death of Rufus&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Norman-Anglorum
rex Willelmus,”</span> in his odd style&mdash;&#8203;but the
story of the dream takes a new shape. A monk in Normandy, in
extreme sickness, sees the usual vision of the Lord and the suppliant
woman, here called less reverentially <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“puella vultu sole speciosior,”</span>
<a name="Page_664" id="Page_664"></a><span class="pageno">664</span>
who complains of the evil doings of Rufus and asks for vengeance
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“celerrimam de eo expetiit vindictam, asserens se a canibus ejus et
lupis potius quam ministris diu esse laniatam”</span>). He has a further
dream about the sins of his own abbot, whom he rebukes, and
causes a letter to be sent to the King. The King mocks, but less
pithily and characteristically than he does in Orderic (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quicumque
sorti vel somniis crediderit, sicut semper vivet suspiciosus et
inquietus, ita semper revertitur”</span>). On this manifestation of unbelief
follows the judgement (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Deus Omnipotens telum quod diu vibraverat
misericorditer, tandem super regem projecit terribiliter”</span>). He
is shot casually in his hunting (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“venatum pergens, <em>venatus est</em>, et
ex improviso sagitta percussus;”</span>&mdash;&#8203;where surely <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“venatus est”</span> is
meant to be passive). He dies without confession or communion;
he is buried, and Henry reigns in his stead. Then, as a kind
of after-thought, comes in the mention of Walter Tirel;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Fertur autem quod eodem die venatum pergenti obtulit munus
sagittarum quidam adveniens, quarum unam Waltero Tirello viro
Ponteiensi in munere dedit secumque venire coegit. Denique silvam
ingressi, dum gregem bestiarum accingunt et invicem trahunt,
eadem sagitta, idem Walterus regem vicinus, ut aiunt, percussit et
subito extinxit.”</p>

<p>The author of the “Brevis Relatio” (Giles, 11) cuts the actual
death of Rufus very short, and mentions no particular actor, but
he connects it in a somewhat singular way with the presence of
Henry;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Contigit vero postea ut Robertus comes Normanniæ Hierosolymam
iret, totamque Normanniam fratri suo Willelmo regi Anglorum
invadiaret, et tunc Henricus fratri suo omnino se conferret
atque cum eo ex toto remaneret. Dum itaque cum eo esset post
aliquantum temporis contigit ut quadam die rex Willelmus venatum
iret, ibique, nescio quo judicio Dei, a quodam milite sagitta percussus
occumberet. Quem statim frater suus Henricus Wintoniam referri
fecit, ibique in ecclesia Sancti Petri ante majus altare sepulturæ
tradidit.”</p>

<p>The introduction of Henry in the former part of the extract is
the more remarkable, because the writer has either copied the
account given by Robert of Torigny in the Continuation of William
of Jumièges (<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 9), or else he has borrowed from the same source.
Robert’s words are;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665"></a><span class="pageno">665</span>
“Igitur, sicut supra diximus, cum Robertus dux Normannorum
anno ab incarnatione Domini mxcvi, Hierusalem perrexisset, et
ducatum Normanniæ Willelmo fratri suo regi Anglorum invadiasset:
contigit post aliquantum temporis, ut idem rex quadam
die venatum iret in Novam forestam, ubi <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> nonas Augusti missa
sagitta incaute a quodam suo familiari in corde percussus, mortuus
est anno ab incarnatione Domini <abbr title="1100">mc.</abbr> regni autem sui <abbr title="13">xiii</abbr>….
Occiso itaque Willelmo rege, ut præmisimus, statim frater suus
Henricus corpus ejus Wintoniam deferri fecit ibique in ecclesia
sancti Petri ante majus altare sepulturæ tradidit.”</p>

<p>The words which I have left out record the death of the elder
Richard, the son of the Conqueror, in the New Forest&mdash;&#8203;the
younger Richard, the son of Robert, is not mentioned&mdash;&#8203;and the
belief that the deaths of the two brothers were the punishment of
the destruction of houses and churches done by their father. One
phrase is remarkable; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Multas villas et ecclesias <em>propter eandem
forestam amplificandam</em> in circuitu ipsius destruxerat.”</span> Here is
nothing about Walter Tirel or any one else by name, and this is the
more to be noticed, because in his own Chronicle, where he seems to
have had before him the account of Henry of Huntingdon, who
mentions Walter Tirel, he leaves out the name. Henry’s words
are; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ivit venatum in Novo foresto in crastino kalendas Augusti,
ubi Walterus Tyrel cum sagitta cervo intendens, regem percussit
inscius. Rex corde ictus corruit, nec verbum edidit.”</span> This in
Robert’s version becomes <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmus rex Anglorum in Nova
Foresta, sibi multum dilecta, cum sagitta incaute cervo intenderetur,
in corde percussus interiit, nec verbum edidit.”</span> He then goes on
to copy part of Henry of Huntingdon’s description of the doings of
Rufus somewhat further on.</p>

<p>Among the monastic chroniclers and annalists, the History of
Abingdon (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 43) seems to see in the Red King’s death a judgement
on him for some dealings connected with the lands of that abbey.
A man described as Hugo de Dun had, by the help of the Count
of Meulan (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Comitis Mellentis Rotberti senioris ope adjutus”</span>), got
into his hands some lands of the abbey at Leckhampsted, as had
also the better known Hugh of Buckland, Sheriff of Berkshire (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“eo
quod et Berchescire vicecomes et publicarum justiciarius compellationum
a rege constitutus existeret”</span>). The writer then goes on;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quadam itaque die rex Willelmus dum cibatus venatum exerceret,
<a name="Page_666" id="Page_666"></a><span class="pageno">666</span>
suorum unus militum, quasi ad cervum sagittam emittens,
regem e contra stantem sibique non caventem eadem sagitta in
corde percussit. Qui mox ad terram corruens exspiravit.”</p>

<p>The legend received at Saint Alban’s (Gesta Abbatum, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 65) seems
to have rolled together the dream of the monk at Gloucester and
the revelation of William’s death to the abbot of Clugny (see <a href="#Page_343"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 343</a>).
Anselm at Clugny has a vision in which many of the saints of
England bring their complaints against King William before the
tribunal of God. Then the story takes a local turn;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Iratus Altissimus respondit,--Accede, Anglorum protomartyr.
Et accedente Albano, tradidit Deus sagittam ardentem, dicens;
vindica te, et omnes sanctos Angliæ, læsos a tyranno. Accipiens
autem Albanus sagittam de manu Domini, projecit eam in terram,
quasi faculam, dicens; Accipe, Satan, potestatem in ipsum Willelmum
tyrannum. Et eadem die, mane, obiit rex transverberatus
per medium pectoris sagitta. Dixit autem arcitenenti, Trahe,
diabole. Erat tunc temporis, episcopo Wolstano defuncto, episcopatus
Wygorniæ nimis afflictus sub manu regis, et multæ aliæ
ecclesiæ, sedente tunc Paschali papa.”</p>

<p>I do not know why the Saint Alban’s writer should have specially
mentioned the church of Worcester, which certainly had a Bishop
(see <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 542) at the time of William’s death. But neither
should I at <a href="#Page_43"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 43</a> of this volume have mentioned Saint Alban’s
among the churches vacant at that time. For the four years’
vacancy which followed the death of Paul was ended in 1097 by the
election of Richard. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Determinata lite quæ in conventu exorta
fuerat inter Normannos, qui jam multiplicati invaluerunt, et Anglos,
qui, jam senescentes et imminuti, occubuerant”</span> (<abbr title="Gesta abbatum one">Gest. Abb. i.</abbr> 66).
Here is a glimpse of the internal state of the convent which would
be most precious if it came from a writer of the year 1097, but
which must be taken for what it may be worth in the mouth of
Matthew Paris or one whom he followed. This abbot Richard was
on good terms with Rufus as well as with his successor (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmi
Secundi et Henrici Primi regum, amicitia familiari fultus, multos
honores et possessiones adeptus est, et adeptas viriliter tuebatur”</span>).
Presently we get a second shorter entry of the Red King’s
death;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tempore quoque hujus abbatis Ricardi, Willelmus rex&mdash;&#8203;immo
tyrannus&mdash;&#8203;ultione divina, obiit sagittatus.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667"></a><span class="pageno">667</span>
The Winchester Annals which really should, just as much as the
Hyde writer, have given us something original at such a moment,
have nothing more to tell us than that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“hoc anno rex a sagitta
perforates est in Nova Foresta a Waltero Tirel et sepultus in
ecclesia Sancti Swithuni Wintoniæ.”</span> The Margam Annals merely
mark that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“hoc anno interfectus est rex Angliæ Willelmus junior,
rex Rufus vulgo vocatus, non. Augusti, anno regni sui <abbr title="13">xiii.</abbr> cum esset
annorum plus <abbr title="40">xl.</abbr>”</span> This reckoning falls in with what I said in <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i.
p.</abbr> 141, and <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume three page">N. C. vol. iii. p.</abbr> 111. Dunstable, which is so strangely
dragged into the tale by Giraldus, and Bermondsey, which has
some special things to record during the reign, have nothing
fresh to tell us, only Dunstable mentions Walter Tirel and Bermondsey
does not. Osney and Worcester merely copy the
usual story. Thomas Wykes has been quoted already. Roger of
Hoveden simply copies Florence. Ralph the Black and Roger of
Wendover at least give a little variety by copying the account
in William of Malmesbury. It is not till we get to the English and
French rimers, Robert of Gloucester and Peter Langtoft, that we
come to anything worthy of much notice or anything showing any
imagination. Robert of Gloucester tells the story of the dream,
attributing it to a monk, but not saying of what monastery. The
appearance on the altar loses perhaps somewhat of its awfulness
when it is made into the ordinary rood of the church.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">“Þat þe kẏng eode into a chẏrche, as fers man and wod,</div>
<div class="i0">And wel hokerlẏche bẏ held þe folc þat þere stod.</div>
<div class="i0">To þe rode he sturte, and bẏgan to frete and gnawe</div>
<div class="i0">Þe armes vaste, and þẏes mẏd hẏs teþ to drawe.</div>
<div class="i0">Þe rode ẏt þolede long, ac suþþe atte laste</div>
<div class="i0">He pulte hẏm wẏt vot, and adoun vp rẏgt hẏm caste.”</div>
</div>

<p>This is surely no improvement on the older version of the story.
Robert does not forget the bodily appearances of the devil recorded
by Florence, but at his distance of time he does not draw the
national distinction which the earlier writer drew;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“Vor þe Deuel was þer byuore þer aboute ẏseẏe</div>
<div class="i0">In fourme of bodẏ, and spec al so mẏd men of þe countreẏe.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>He then goes on to tell the story, clearly after William of
Malmesbury, but everywhere with touches of his own. They have
the interest of being in any case the earliest detailed account, true
<a name="Page_668" id="Page_668"></a><span class="pageno">668</span>
or false, of the story in our own tongue. Thus the account of the
King’s not going to hunt before dinner takes this shape;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“So þat þe kẏng was adrad and bẏleuede vor such cas</div>

</div><!--end poem-->

<p>The actual account of his death stands thus;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">“He prẏkede after vaste ẏnou toward þe West rẏgt.</div>

</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Peter of Langtoft (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 446) has some touches of his own. Among
other things, the days of the week have got wrong, in order to
bring in a precept as to the proper observance of the weekly fast-day.
We also get a purely imaginary Bishop of Winchester;</p>

<p>This last line, fittingly according to the belief of William’s own
time, is wanting in some manuscripts.</p>

<p>From the writer known as Bromton we might have looked for
some new form of the legend, but he gives us (X Scriptt. 996)
only the usual story about Walter Tirel, with a rhetorical character
of William and an account of his evil doings. One or two
expressions however are remarkable;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In quodam loco ubi priscis temporibus ecclesia fuerat constructa,
et tempore patris sui cum multis aliis ecclesiis, et quatuor
domibus religiosis, et tota illa patria in solitudinem redacta, vitam
crudelem fine miserrimo terminavit. Jure autem in medio injustitiæ
suæ inter feras occiditur, qui ultra modum inter homines
ferus erat. Nam stabilitis contra malefactores silvarum, forestarum,
et venationis, legibus duris, zelotepia sua agente, custos boscorum et
ferarum pastor communiter vocabatur.”</p>

<p>To Knighton’s curious account I have referred already (see
<a href="#Page_333"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 333</a>). But he tells the story twice. His first version (X Scriptt.
2372) contains nothing remarkable; the second (2373) is quite
worth notice. He attributes to Rufus the making of the New
Forest, which he describes in words which are not, as far as one
can see, copied from any of the usual sources. He enforced the
forest laws with great harshness, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quod pro dama hominem suspenderet,
pro lepore <abbr title="20 solidi">xx.<span class="decoration">s.</span></abbr> plecteretur, pro cuniculo <abbr title="10 solidi">x.<span class="decoration">s.</span></abbr> daret.”</span>
Then the last scene is brought in with some solemnity; but the
age which he assigns to the Red King is quite impossible;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Igitur, ut ante dictum est, <abbr title="3">iii.</abbr> nonarum Augusti, per Cistrensem

se sustinuit. At rex objurganter cum magno impetu præcepit
ei, dicens, ‘Trahe, trahe, arcum ex parte diaboli, et extendas
sagittam, alias te pœnitebit,’ At ille emisit sagittam, volens interficere
cervum, percussit regem per medium cordis, et occidit eum,
ibidemque expiravit. Walterus evasit, nemine insequente. Rex
vero vehitur apud Wyntoniam super redam caballariam impositus.
In cujus sepultura luctus defuit. Omnes gaudium de ejus morte
arripiunt, adeo quod vix erat quispiam qui lacrimam emiserit, sed
omnes de morte ejus lætati sunt.”</p>

<p>This is well told; but how much more men knew about the
matter at the end of the fourteenth century than they did in the
last year of the eleventh.</p>

<p class="p2">To turn to foreign writers, the Annales Cambriæ say simply
that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmus rex Angliæ, a quodam milite suo cervum petente
sagitta percussus, interiit”</span>&mdash;&#8203;or, in another manuscript, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmus
rex Anglorum, <em>improviso ictu</em> sagittæ a quodam milite in venatu
occubuit.”</span> The difference is to be noted. The Brut records the
death of William the Red, King of the Saxons (Gẃilim Goch,
brenhin y Saeson), and says that “as he was on a certain day
hunting, along with Henry, his youngest brother, accompanied
by some of his knights, he was wounded with an arrow by
Walter Tyrell, a knight of his own, who, unwittingly, as he was
shooting at a stag, hit the king and killed him.”</p>

<p>The Annales Blandinienses in Pertz, <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 27, record how <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“secundus
Willelmus rex Anglorum in venatione ab uno milite suo ex
improvisu sagitta vulneratus obiit; cui successit Henricus frater
suus.”</span> The Saint Denis History (Pertz, <abbr title="nine">ix.</abbr> 405) has a further
touch; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmus Rufus, rex Anglorum, venationi intentus sagitta</span>
<a name="Page_671" id="Page_671"></a><span class="pageno">671</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incaute emissa occiditur. Cui Henricus frater ejus <em>velocissime successit</em>,
ne impediretur a Roberto fratre suo, jam de Hierosolimitana
expeditione reverso.”</span> Another writer in the same volume (<abbr title="nine">ix.</abbr> 392),
Hugh of Fleury, has a remarkable account, quite in the spirit
of the English writers, but seemingly not directly copied from any
of them;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex Anglorum Guillelmus, magnifici regis Guillelmi successor
et filius, dum venationem exercet in silva quæ adjacet Vindoniæ
urbi, a quodam milite sagitta percussus interiit. Ille tamen miles
qui sagittam jecit illum inscientem percussit. Cervam quippe
sagittare parabat, sed sagitta retrorsum acta regem insperate percussit,
et illum inopinabiliter interemit. Quod divino nutu contigisse
non dubium est. Erat enim rex ille armis quidem strenuus
atque munificus, sed nimis lasciviens et flagitiosus. Verum antequam
interiret, magnis sibi signis præostensis, si voluisset, corrigi
debuisset. Nam dum sibi subitus, peccatis suis exigentibus, immineret
interitus, in eadem insula in qua manebat sanguinis unda
fœtida per spatium unius diei emanavit, <em>ipso præsente</em>, quod dicebatur
ejus portendere mortem. Ipso etiam tempore apparuerunt alia
signa stupenda in eadem insula, quibus, sicut jam dictum est,
terreri et vitam suam corrigere debuisset. Quæ juventa stolidus
et honore superbus contempsit, et semper incorrigibilis mansit.
Unde Dei justo judicio subite et intempestiva morte preventus
occubuit. Cui successit frater ejus junior Henricus, vir sapiens
atque modestus.”</p>

<p>Hugh of Flavigny, whom we have already had often to quote,
adds (Pertz, <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 495) one detail which I do not think appears
elsewhere. The King goes to see the well which sent up blood
(the event is wrongly put under 1099);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Anno inc. dom. 1099 obiit Urbanus papa, successit Paschalis.
Obiit etiam Willelmus junior rex Anglorum. Quo etiam anno in
Anglia fons verum sanguinem olidum et putentem manare visus
est. Ad quod spectaculum cum fere tota insula cucurrisset, insolita
rei novitate stupefacta, rex præfatus advenit et vidit, nec tamen
ei profuit vidisse. Autumabat vulgus promiscuum portentum istud
mortem regis portendere, quod etiam ei dicebatur a referentibus;
sed homo secularis et in quem timor Dei non ceciderat, voluptatibus
carnis et superbiæ deditus, divinorum præceptorum contemptor
et adversarius, qui tamen satis regii fuisset animi, si non
<a name="Page_672" id="Page_672"></a><span class="pageno">672</span>
Deum postposuisset fastu regni inflatus, nec cogitabat se moriturum.”</p>

<p>He carries on this vein a little further, and then gives the account
of his death;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quia Deum deseruit, sanctam ecclesiam opprimens et eam sibi
ancillari constituens, a Deo quoque derelictus est; in silva quæ
adjacet Wintoniæ civitati, dum venationem exercet, sagitta a
quodam percussus, quo lethali vulnere decidit et exanimatus est,
pœnitentia et communione carens, et apud eamdem urbem sepultus.”</p>

<p>The Angevin chroniclers record the death of Rufus without
comment or detail. The Biographer of the Bishops of Le Mans
(Vet. An. 309), who looks at the matter chiefly with reference to
Bishop Hildebert, moralizes at some length; but his statement of
fact is no more than this;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dum quadam die in silvam venandi gratia perrexisset, ab uno
ex militibus qui secum ierant sagitta percussus, interiit.”</p>

<p>This is really hardly more than the few words of the English
Chronicler. Alberic of Trois Fontaines, from whom we might
have looked for something, merely copies William of Malmesbury
and others. Gervase of Tilbury (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 20, Leibnitz, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 945) mentions
another agent in the death-blow;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Defuncto patre successit Guillelmus <i>primogenius</i> in regnum,
vir impius, ecclesiarum persecutor, immisericors circa imbelles, qui
archiepiscopum Cantuariensem plurimum persecutus, <em>ab angelo
percutiente peremtus</em>, Guintoniæ sepultus est, sub infamiæ perpetuo
monumento.”</p>

<p class="p2">As for Walter Tirel, he has his place in ordinary memory so
thoroughly as the slayer of William Rufus and as nothing else,
that it is rather hard to take in that his position as the slayer
of William Rufus is very doubtful, while there are undoubted,
though meagre, notices of him in other characters. We have already
seen him entertaining Anselm in one of his Picard dwellings. The
fullest account of his family comes from Orderic, who, when he is
commenting on the laxity of the Norman clergy and bishops in his
time, gives us the story of Walter’s father (574 D). Dean Fulk was
a pupil of Bishop Ivo of Chartres, and inherited a knight’s fee
from his father. Then we read how <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“illius temporis ritu, nobilem</span>
<a name="Page_673" id="Page_673"></a><span class="pageno">673</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sociam nomine Orieldem habuit, ex qua copiosam prolem generavit.”</span>
Walter was one of a family of ten, seemingly the youngest of eight
sons. He was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“cognomento Tirellus,”</span> clearly a personal and not
a hereditary or local surname.</p>

<p>If the Dean of Evreux kept proper residence, his son would
be Norman <em>natione</em>, whatever he was <em>genere</em>; but most accounts
of Walter connect him with France rather than with Normandy.
Abbot Suger, who knew him personally, speaks of him (Duchèsne,
<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 283 C) as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“nobilissimus vir Galterius Tirellus.”</span> In Florence
(1100) he is simply <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quidam Francus, Walterus cognomento
Tirellus.”</span> William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 333) says that, on the day
of the King’s death, he was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“paucis comitatus, quorum familiarissimus
erat Walterius cognomento Tirel, qui de Francia, liberalitate
regis adductus, venerat.”</span> His possession of Poix appears from
Orderic, 782 A, where he is described as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“de Francia miles
generosus, Picis et Pontisariæ dives oppidanus, potens inter optimates
et in armis acerrimus; ideo regi familiaris conviva et ubique
comes assiduus.”</span> Walter Map (De Nugis Cur. 222) calls him
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“miles Achaza juxta Pontissaram Franciæ,”</span> which I suppose means
Achères. (But in Orderic, 723 B, we have another Walter and
also a Peter brought into connexion with Achères.) Walter’s
connexion with that district suggests that the King had bought
him over to his side, or had taken him prisoner during the campaign
in the Vexin. Geoffrey Gaimar (<abbr title="Chroniques Anglo-Normandes one">Chron. Anglo-Norm. i.</abbr> 51) dwells
on his possession of Poix;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="unindent">His marriage comes from Orderic (783 A); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Adelidam filiam
Ricardi de sublimi prosapia Gifardorum conjugem habuit, quæ
Hugonem de Pice, strenuissimum militem, marito suo peperit.”</span></p>

<p>The question now comes whether Walter Tirel appears in Domesday.
There is in Essex (41) an entry, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Laingaham tenet Walterus
Tirelde. R. quod tenuit Phin dacus pro <abbr title="2">ii.</abbr> hidis et dimidia et pro
uno manerio.”</span> This comes among the estates of Richard of Clare,
and I suppose that “R.” in the entry should be “de R.” as in
<a name="Page_674" id="Page_674"></a><span class="pageno">674</span>
several others. If this be our Walter Tirel, his estate was not
very great, and he did not hold as a tenant-in-chief. One cannot
make much out of the extract from an East-Saxon county history
in Ellis, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 394. Lappenberg (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 207) has more to say about this
entry and other bearers of the name of Tirel. It cannot much
matter that <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“der Name Tirrel ist in der Liste der Krieger zu
Battle Abbey.”</span> It is of more importance when he refers to the
Pipe Roll of Henry (56), where we read, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Adeliz uxor Walteri
Tirelli reddit compotum de <abbr title="10">x.</abbr> marcis argenti de eisdem placitis
de La Wingeham.”</span> This comes in Essex, and I suppose that the
“Laingaham” of Domesday and the “La Wingeham” of the Pipe
Roll are the same place. If so, the two entries, combined with
the notice in Orderic, look very much as if they all belong to one
Walter and one Adelaide. If this be so, Walter Tirel was a landowner
in England, though on no great scale; and whatever was
his own case, his wife or widow was living and holding his land
in 1131.</p>

<p>Walter’s denial of any share in the King’s death comes from
the personal knowledge of Abbot Suger (Duchèsne, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 283); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Imponebatur
a quibusdam cuidam nobilissimo viro Galterio Tirello,
quod eum sagitta perfoderat. Quem cum nec timeret, nec speraret,
jurejurando sæpius audivimus, et quasi sacrosanctum asserere, quod
ea die nec in eam partem silvæ in qua rex venabatur, venerit, nec
eum in silva omnino viderit.”</span></p>

<p>John of Salisbury in his Life of Anselm, <abbr title="100 12">c. xii</abbr> (Giles, <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 341), refers
to this denial on the part of Walter. He speaks of the fate of Julian,
likening Anselm to Basil, and goes on; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quis alterutrum miserit
telum, adhuc incertum est quidem. Nam Walterus Tyrrellus ille,
qui regiæ necis reus a plurimis dictus est, eo quod illi familiaris
erat et tunc in indagine ferarum vicinus, et fere singulariter adhærebat,
etiam quum ageret in extremis, se a cæde illius immunem
esse, invocato in animam suam Dei judicio, protestatus est. Fuerunt
plurimi, <em>qui ipsum regem jaculum quo interemptus est misisse
asserunt</em>; et hoc Walterus ille, etsi non crederetur ei, constanter
asserebat.”</span> He adds a comment which might be taken in two
senses; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Et profecto quisquis hoc fecerit, Dei ecclesiæ suæ calamitatibus
compatientis dispositioni fideliter obedivit.”</span></p>

<p>The very confused story which makes William Rufus the maker
of the New Forest, and Walter Tirel the adviser of the deed, comes
<a name="Page_675" id="Page_675"></a><span class="pageno">675</span>
from Walter Map’s account (De Nugis, 222) of the death of William
Rufus, where a good many things are brought close together;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willielmus secundus, rex Angliæ, regum pessimus, Anselmo pulso
a sede Cantiæ, justo Dei judicio a sagitta volante pulsus, quia
dæmonio meridiano deditus, cujus ad nutum vixerat, onere pessimo
levavit orbem. Notandum autem quod <em>in silva Novæ Forestæ</em></span>
[<abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 841], <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quam ipse Deo et hominibus abstulerat,
ut eam dicaret feris et canum lusibus, a qua triginta sex matrices
ecclesias extirpaverat, et populum earum dederat <em>exterminio</em>. Consiliarius
autem hujus ineptiæ Walterus Tyrell, miles Achaza juxta
Pontissaram Franciæ, qui, non sponte sua sed Domini, de medio
fecit eum ictu sagittæ, quæ feram penetrans cecidit in belluam Deo
odibilem.”</span> “Exterminium” must of course be taken, not of a
massacre, but of a mere driving out. Giraldus too (De Inst. Princ.
173) attributes the making of the New Forest and the driving out
of the people to William Rufus;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hic Novam in australibus Angliæ partibus Forestam, quæ
usque hodie durat, primus instituit; multis ibidem ecclesiis, in
quibus divina ab antiquo celebrari obsequia et ipsius præconia
sublimari, desertis omnino et destitutis multisque ruricolis et
glebæ ascriptis a paternis laribus et agris avitis miserabiliter profugatis
et proscriptis.”</p>

<p>We have seen already (see <a href="#Page_337"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 337</a>) how this confusion was further
improved in the thirteenth century at the hands of Thomas
Wykes, and what rhetorical use of it was made later still by Henry
Knighton.</p>

<p class="p2">As usual, so-called local tradition knows a vast deal about the
matter. The exact place where Rufus fell is known, and is marked
by a stone. The tree from which, in some versions, the arrow
is said to have glanced, is also known, and its site, or a successor,
may be seen. It is of course impossible to say that these things
are not so; but one knows too much of the utter worthlessness
of the modern guesses which commonly pass for local tradition to
attach much value to such stories. I have been on the spot; but,
when there is no real evidence to fix the event to one spot rather
than another of a large district, it is another matter from tracing
out the signs of real history at Le Mans and at Rochester, at
Bamburgh and at Saint Cenery. There is also a wild story about
<a name="Page_676" id="Page_676"></a><span class="pageno">676</span>
a payment made by some neighbouring manor as a penalty, because
some one shod Walter’s horse instead of stopping him. The payment
is doubtless real enough; the alleged cause for it shows a
knowledge of details beyond that of Knighton or Geoffrey Gaimar.
The critical historian, after making his way through all these tales,
can only come back to the safe statement of the English Chronicler
with which he set out.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Burial of William Rufus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Some</span> of the accounts of William’s burial have been already
mentioned in the text, or in the last Note. It may have been
noticed that some of them seem anxious to claim for Henry a
share in the burial of his brother. The singular narrative of
Geoffrey Gaimar (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 56), where he follows up his attempt to make
out a late repentance for Rufus by giving him a specially solemn
and Christian burial, has been given in brief in the text. The barons
and the rest are mourning, when Gilbert of Laigle bids them stop
(“Taisez, seigneurs, pur Jhésu Xpist”) and turn to burying their
master. Then the story goes on;</p>

<p>This is a pretty story enough; but we may be sure that all
its other details are as mythical as the part assigned to the dead
Bishop Walkelin. The only question of any importance is whether
there is any contradiction between the two more important narratives,
that of Orderic and that of William of Malmesbury in the place
where he is directly telling the story. The Chronicler and Florence
simply mention the burial without detail or comment. The account
of William of Malmesbury is the shorter of the two. The King
has been shot, and Walter Tirel has fled. Then the story goes on
(<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 333);</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nec vero fuit qui persequeretur, illis conniventibus, istis miserantibus,

obviam processerunt, et pro reverentia regiæ dignitatis in veteri
monasterio Sancti Petri celeriter tumulaverunt.”</p>

<p>The words of William of Malmesbury, it will be noticed, are quite
general. They do not assert the usual religious ceremony, but
neither do they exclude it. It is Orderic who in a marked way
asserts the popular excommunication. His words are;</p>

<p lang="la" xml:lang="la"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678"></a><span class="pageno">678</span>
“Porro ecclesiastici doctores et prælati, sordidam ejus vitam et
tetrum finem considerantes, tunc judicare ausi sunt, et ecclesiastica,
veluti biothanatum, absolutione indignum censuerunt, quem vitales
auras carpentem salubriter a nequitiis castigare nequiverunt. Signa
etiam pro illo in quibusdam ecclesiis non sonuerunt, quæ pro infimis
pauperibus et mulierculis crebro diutissime pulsata sunt. De
ingenti ærario, ubi plures nummorum acervi de laboribus miserorum
congesti sunt, eleemosynæ pro anima cupidi quondam possessoris
nullæ inopibus erogatæ sunt.”</p>

<p>Here is no contradiction; only Orderic asserts a very remarkable
feature in the case of which William takes no notice. To me it
seems more likely that William of Malmesbury, whose business it
clearly was (see above, <a href="#Page_491"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 491</a>) to make out as good a case for
William Rufus as he could without asserting anything positively
false, should leave out a circumstance which told so much against the
King, than that Orderic, or those from whom he heard the story,
should invent or imagine it. On the other hand, the very fact that
the story of the popular excommunication is so very striking and
solemn and in every way befitting does make us tremble the least
bit in admitting it as a piece of authentic history.</p>

<p>We must not however forget that William of Malmesbury in a
later passage (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 393) does seem to imply that the burial of Rufus
was accompanied by the ordinary ceremonies. In recording the
election of Henry, he says that it happened <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“post justa funeri regio
persoluta.”</span> But it may fairly be doubted whether an <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter dictum</em>
of this kind is entitled to the same weight which would undoubtedly
have belonged to a direct statement in his regular narrative. The
words are, after all, somewhat vague, and if we compare this passage
in William of Malmesbury with the entry in the Chronicle, it
sounds very much as if it were merely a translation in a grander
style of the simple words “syðþan he bebyrged wæs.” The same
feeling as that which is expressed in Orderic’s account comes out in
a singular passage of the Saxon Annalist (Pertz, <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 733); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willehelmus
rex de Anglia sagitta interfectus est. Heinricus vero frater
ejus in eodem loco pro remedio animi sui volens monasterium
constituere, prohibitus est. Apparuit enim ei, et duo dracones
ferentes eum, dicens, nichil sibi prodesse, eo quod suis temporibus
omnia destructa essent, quæ antecessores sui in honorem Domini
construxerant.”</span></p>

<p><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679"></a><span class="pageno">679</span>
I suppose that there need be no difficulty about the “clientuli”
of Orderic as compared with the “rusticani” of William, though the
word “clientuli” by itself might rather have suggested some of the
King’s inferior followers. But one is amazed to find Sir Francis
Palgrave (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 686, 687) telling us the name of the churl who
brought in the body, “a neighbouring charcoal-burner, Purkis.”
And he goes on to say;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“We are not told that Purkis received any reward or thanks
for his care. His family still subsists in the neighbourhood,
nor have they risen above their original station, poor craftsmen
or cottagers. They followed the calling of coal-burners until
a recent period; and they tell us that the wheel of the Cart
which conveyed the neglected corpse was shown by them until the
last century.”</p>

<p>I have often heard of this local legend about Purkis, but really
so palpable a fiction ought not to have found its way into the pages
of a scholar like Sir Francis Palgrave. There are some stories
which need no argument against them, but which the evidence of
nomenclature at once upsets. Purkis is on the face of him as
mythical as Crocker and Crewis and Copleston&mdash;&#8203;I am not sure
whether I have remembered the first two names right, and it is not
worth turning to any book to see. By the way in which the story
is told, one would fancy that Purkis is meant for a surname, and it
may be that those who believe in him think that he was baptized
John or Thomas. In inventing legends it is at least better to
invent legends which are possible. If any one chooses to say that
the cart was driven by Godwine or Æthelstan, we cannot say that it
was not.</p>

<p class="p2">It is after this that Orderic goes on to speak of the classes of
people who did mourn for the Red King, and how gladly they
would have done summary vengeance on his slayer, if he had not
been far out of their reach;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Stipendiarii milites et nebulones ac vulgaria scorta quæstus suos

<p class="center sc">The Election of Henry the First.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> details of the accession of Henry come chiefly from Orderic
(782 D), though, oddly enough, he does not record the election in so
many words. But there can be no doubt as to the fact of a regular,
though necessarily a very hasty, election. The words of the
Chronicle are distinct; “And syðþan he bebyrged wæs þa witan þe
þa neh handa wæron, his broðer Heanrig to cynge gecuran.” So
Henry of Huntingdon; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Henricus, ibidem in regem electus.”</span>
Florence strangely slurs over the election, saying only, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“successit
junior frater suus Heinricus.”</span> William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 393)
is quite distinct;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In regem electus est, aliquantis tamen ante controversiis inter
proceres agitatis atque sopitis, annitente maxime comite Warwicensi
Henrico, viro integro et sancto, cujus familiari jamdudum usus
fuerat contubernio.”</p>

<p>Here we hear only of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“proceres;”</span> but we get the important
facts of the division among the electors, and of the special agency
of the Earl of Warwick, which falls in with the notice of Orderic
(783 B) that the Count of Meulan accompanied the King-elect to
London. The Beaumont brothers act together. But Orderic, in
his zeal to describe the picturesque scene between Henry and William
of Breteuil, leaves out any distinct record of the election. It
is however implied in the words which follow the passage quoted
in <a href="#Page_347"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 347;</a></p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tandem, convenientibus amicis et sapientibus consiliariis, hinc
et inde lis mitigata est, et saniori consultu, ne pejor scissura fieret,
arx cum regalibus gazis filio regis Henrico reddita est.”</p>

<p>The assembly which settled the matter, and which gave up the
royal treasury to Henry, was beyond all doubt the assembly which,
according to William of Malmesbury, elected Henry king. It was
only to a king or king-elect that they would decree the surrender
of the treasure. Indeed one might be tempted to make a slight
<a name="Page_681" id="Page_681"></a><span class="pageno">681</span>
change in the order of events as told by Orderic. One is tempted
to suspect that the assembly voted the election of Henry, that he
went, armed with this vote, to demand the treasure, and that it
was then that William of Breteuil withstood him. This however is
simply conjecture. But there can be no doubt as to the election of
Henry by such an assembly as could be got together at the
moment. Nor do I see any reason to doubt Orderic’s story as to
the scene between Henry and William of Breteuil. At all events,
Orderic has made it the occasion of putting forward some very
sound constitutional doctrine, which is just as valuable, even if any
severe critic should reject the story as a fact.</p>

<p class="p2">I have spoken elsewhere (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 845) of two tales
in Matthew Paris with regard to Henry’s accession, of which
Thierry made a characteristic use. I have nothing to add to what
I said then.</p>

<p class="p2">There can, I think, be no doubt that the celebrant at Henry’s
coronation was Maurice Bishop of London. The Chronicler,
Florence, Orderic, and Henry of Huntingdon, all mention Maurice
and no other prelate, though of course some other bishops would
take a secondary part in the ceremony. The Archbishop of York
would have been the regular celebrant during the vacancy of Canterbury;
but, as Thomas died so soon afterwards, the natural inference
is that he was too sick to come. And indeed, if he was in his own
province, he could not, even if he had been in the best of health,
have come to Westminster at such short notice. Even Thomas
Stubbs does not claim the consecration of Henry for his namesake,
unless indeed he means (X Scriptt. 1707) to insinuate it in a very
dark way. He mentions the vacancy of Canterbury after the death
of Lanfranc, and adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ex antiquo tamen extitit consuetudo inter duos Angliæ metropolitanos,
ut altero defuncto alter in provincia defuncti archiepiscopalia
faceret, utpote episcopos consecrare, regem coronare, coronato
rege natalis domini, paschæ et pentecostes majorem missam cantare.
Hæc interim fecit Thomas archiepiscopus, nec quisquam
episcoporum erat qui hæc in sua ipsius diocesi præsente archiepiscopo
præsumeret.”</p>

<p>He then mentions the bishops whom Thomas consecrated, Hervey
<a name="Page_682" id="Page_682"></a><span class="pageno">682</span>
of Norwich&mdash;&#8203;that is, Herbert of Thetford&mdash;&#8203;Ralph of Chichester, and
Hervey of Bangor. If he had really thought that Thomas had
crowned a king, he would surely have said so distinctly. I can
therefore attach no importance to the strange statement of the two
Ely writers (Anglia Sacra, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 613; Stewart, Liber Eliensis, 284)
that Henry was consecrated by Maurice, but crowned by Thomas
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“a Mauritio Lundoniensi episcopo in regem est consecratus, sed
a Thoma Eboracensi coronatus”</span>). But the distinction between
consecration and coronation may be worth the attention of ritual
students.</p>

<p class="p2">It was an easy mistake of a Welsh writer (see the Brut, 1098,
that is 1100) to transfer the election from Winchester to London;
“From thence [Winchester] he went to London, and took possession
of it, which is the chiefest and crown of the whole kingdom of
England [Lloeger]. Then the French and Saxons [Ffreinc a
Saeson] all flocked together to him, and by royal council appointed
him king in England [vrenhin yn Lloeger].”</p>

<p class="center sc">The Objections to the Marriage of Henry and
Matilda.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Our</span> two fullest accounts of this matter are those of Eadmer and
of Hermann of Tournay (D’Achery, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 894, see above, <a href="#Page_600"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 600</a>).
Eadmer’s is the account, not only of a contemporary, but, we cannot
doubt, of an eye-witness. Hermann wrote in another land,
long afterwards, when the wars of Stephen and Matilda and the
pleadings in the papal court (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 857) had called men’s
minds back to the story of the marriage of Matilda’s parents. His
memory, as we see, failed him as to details. He did not remember
either of the names of Eadgyth-Matilda; he mistakes her brother
David for her father; he makes her (D’Achery, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 894) the mother
of both the sons of Henry who were drowned in the White Ship.
It is quite plain that his remembrance of what he had heard from
Anselm forty or fifty years before was coloured by later ways of
looking at things.</p>

<p><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683"></a><span class="pageno">683</span>
It is quite plain from Eadmer’s account that Eadgyth herself
had not the slightest feeling against the marriage, but that she
was eager for it; she disliked neither King Henry nor his crown.
Nor has Anselm any objection, as soon as the evidence shows that
no rule of the Church would be broken by the marriage. That
he was strict in requiring such evidence was only natural and right;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Affirmabat nulla se unquam ratione in hoc declinandum ut suam
Deo sponsam tollat et eam terreno homini in matrimonium jungat”</span>
(Eadmer, <abbr title="Historia novorum">Hist. Nov.</abbr> 56). But when the evidence shows that
Eadgyth was not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dei sponsa,”</span> he makes no further objection.
Nothing is proved by his use of a negative form, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“judicium vestrum
non abjicio”</span> (<abbr title="Historia novorum">Hist. Nov.</abbr> 58). The sentimental objection which
Hermann puts into his mouth seems quite out of character.
Anselm takes the common-sense view; If she is a nun, she must
not marry; if she is not a nun, she may. One can believe that
Anselm would in his heart have preferred that any virgin should
abide in the state which he deemed the higher. But he would
hardly have stooped to say; “This marriage is perfectly lawful;
but the veil has touched her head; so you had better marry
somebody else.” In this and in the prophecy we surely see the
beginning of the growth of a legend. Some legends of Anselm
seem to have arisen in his life-time. This one could not, as no
ill-luck happened to the children of the marriage till after Anselm
was dead.</p>

<p>I am not sure that a very slight touch in the same direction
may not be seen in the account of William of Malmesbury, <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 418;
the words follow the passage quoted above, <a href="#Page_603"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 603</a>; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cum rex
suscipere vellet eam thalamo, res in disceptationem venit; nec
nisi legitimis productis testibus, qui eam jurarent sine professione
causa procorum velum gessisse, archiepiscopus adduci potuit ad
consentiendum.”</span></p>

<p>William, it is to be noticed, does not repeat the English
pedigree, on which in his former notice (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 393) he was less
emphatic than Eadmer. I do not know what can be meant by
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ignobiles nuptiæ.”</span> Hardly Count Alan; hardly Earl William
of Warren or Surrey, who is also spoken of.</p>

<p class="p2">Thierry (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 152) has an elaborate romance, in which the father
of Western theology comes in casually as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“un moine du Bec,</span>
<a name="Page_684" id="Page_684"></a><span class="pageno">684</span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nommé Anselme.”</span> Here Eadgyth dislikes the marriage, but
sacrifices herself for the good of her people. All this comes from
Matthew Paris, who has two amazing stories. In one (<abbr title="Historia Anglorum">Hist. Angl.</abbr>
<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 188), though Malcolm and Margaret have been killed off at the
proper time, they appear again in full life when King Henry
seeks their daughter&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“filia elegantissimæ speciei, et, quod pluris
erat, vitæ sanctissimæ.”</span> She was brought up in a monastery, perhaps
as a nun (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in sanctimonialium claustro propter honestatem
educata, et, ut dicitur, velo sacro Deo dicato ac jam professa”</span>).
King Henry woos her with much fervour of passion (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ipsam
propter ipsius mores et faciei venustatem sitienter adoptavit, et
instanter petiit in uxorem”</span>). The parents dare not withstand such
a lover; they go to ask their daughter’s own wishes. She rebukes
them in fearful and mysterious words for speaking of any such
matter (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“increpans patrem et matrem de zelotipiæ præsumptione,
nec ipsos debere de corpore suo fructum mortalitatis exposcere,
vel fructum posteritatis infructuosum”</span>). At this the father is
sad; the mother is pleased by the decision of her daughter (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“matri
propositum puellare complacuit”</span>). The King’s passion only waxes
warmer; like Balak, he sends more honourable messengers; he
commands, prays, promises, till he stumbles into a hexameter
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“missis sollemnioribus nuntiis, urgentius adolescentulam in
reginam expostulans, imperium, promissa, preces, confudit in
unum”</span>). Malcolm, knowing that his wife will never agree to
the marriage, turns, without her knowledge, to the abbess by
whom his daughter had been brought up. The reverend mother
is prevailed on to argue the point at length, and to set forth
every possible argument, personal and political, on behalf of the
marriage;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Proponens utilitatem inde proventuram, scilicet regnorum
fœdera, regum mutuam dilectionem, pacis tranquillitatem, propagationis
posteritatem, reginalem dignitatem, honoris magnificentiam,
divitiarum affluentiam, amoris desiderium, amatoris pulcritudinem.”</p>

<p>Father and abbess together are too much for the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“beata virgo
Matilda.”</span> She yields, but only <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“maledicens fructui sui ventris
affuturo.”</span> Anselm marries them, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“nuptiis sollemniter, ut decuit,
celebratis;”</span> but a contemporary note in the margin is added,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nota nuptias illicitas.”</span> And we are told that the disturbances
<a name="Page_685" id="Page_685"></a><span class="pageno">685</span>
which presently followed, the invasion of Robert and anything
else, were all judgements on this unlawful marriage;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Facta est commotio magna in regno, quasi Deo irato, quoniam
rex Henricus zelotipaverat, et, sicut fratrem Robertum de regno
supplantando alienaverat, sic Christum de sponsa sua defraudaverat.”</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that the writer who brings in all this action
of Malcolm under the year 1101 had long before (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 43) recorded
his death in its proper place, or rather before its proper place, as
he puts it in 1092 instead of 1093.</p>

<p>The other account comes in the Chronica Majora, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 121. It
is chiefly remarkable for two speeches, the second of which is put
into the mouth of Matilda herself. Matthew had just copied a
business-like bit from Roger of Wendover (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 169), recording the
marriage without comment; he then goes on to say that Matilda
was married against her will, being won over by the importunity
of kinsfolk and friends. The words are, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“parentum et amicorum
consiliis vix adquiescens; tandem tædio affecta, adquievit.”</span>
(“Parentes” may be taken by the charitably disposed in the wider
French sense, but it must be remembered that in the other version
Malcolm and Margaret are brought in as living in the year 1100.)
This version is quite certain that Matilda had made a vow, but
leaves it open whether she had actually taken the veil (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cum
Christiana matertera sancta sanctissime in claustro religionis
educata fuerat, et votum virginitatis Deo spoponderat, et, ut multi
perhibent, velum susceperat professæ religionis”</span>). The kinsfolk
and friends make a solemn appeal on patriotic grounds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“O mulierum generosissima ac gratissima, per te reparabitur
Anglorum genialis nobilitas, quæ diu degeneravit, et fœdus magnorum
principum redintegrabitur, si matrimonio prælocuto consentias.
Quod si non feceris, causa eris perennis inimicitiæ
gentium diversarum, et sanguinis humani effusionis irrestaurabilis.”</p>

<p>Matilda, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“virgo clementissima,”</span> gets angry, and, in the bitterness
of her soul, uses yet stronger language than she does in the
other version;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ex quo sic oportet fieri, utcunque consentio, sed fructum
ventris mei, quod est horribile dictu, diabolo commendo. Me enim
Deo vovi, quod non sinistis, immo sponsum meum, quem elegi,
<a name="Page_686" id="Page_686"></a><span class="pageno">686</span>
ausu temerario, immemores causæ sancti Matthæi apostoli, zelotipatis.”</p>

<p>We are then told of the vehement love of the King for the wife
whom he had thus wrongfully married;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sic igitur nuptiæ magnifice, ut decuit, celebrabantur, et tanto
ardentius exarsit rex in ipsius amorem, quanto scelestius adamavit.
Secundum illud poeticum</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="i0a">“Nitimur in vetitum semper.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peccato igitur exigente, facta est commotio subito in regno.”</p>

<p>From this point Matthew goes on copying Roger of Wendover’s
account of Robert’s invasion, but putting in bits of colouring of his
own. When Henry sends his fleet to meet that of Robert, we are
told that he does it <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“conscientiam habens multipliciter cauteriatam.”</span>
And when some of the sailors (see <a href="#Page_404"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 404</a>)&mdash;&#8203;who are enlarged
by Robert of Wendover into <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pars major exercitus”</span>&mdash;&#8203;go over to
Robert, the reason for their so doing is said to be <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quia rex jam
tyrannizaverat.”</span></p>

<p>There is something very strange in this echo at so late a time of
objections which one would have thought that both common sense
and the authority of Anselm would have set aside for ever. Was
there any lurking wish in the thirteenth century to weaken the
title of the Angevin kings, even on so stale a ground as the doubtful
validity of the marriage of so distant an ancestress? We must
remember that something of the kind really happened in Scotland
long after. The right of the Stewarts was murmured against at
a very late time on the ground of the doubtful marriage of
Robert the Second. And we have seen that in an intermediate
time, during the reign of Stephen, the validity of the elder Matilda’s
marriage, and the consequent legitimacy of the younger Matilda,
were called in question by Stephen’s supporters in arguments
before the papal court. See <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 857.</p>

<p class="p2">There is something singular in the way in which the marriage
is entered in the Winchester Annals (1100), among a crowd of
other facts not put in exact chronological order; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Matildis, Malcolmi
regis filia Scotiæ, de monacha Wiltoniæ non tamen professa,
regina Angliæ facta est.”</span> One almost thinks of the wild story
about Eadgyth of Wilton which I have spoken of in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume one page">N. C. vol. i.
p.</abbr> 267.
<a name="Page_687" id="Page_687"></a><span class="pageno">687</span>
But the words have a parallel in the language of the Brut
(1098, that is 1110), which, after the account of Henry’s election,
adds,</p>

<p>“And immediately he took for his wife Mahalt, daughter of
Malcolm, king of Prydyn, by Queen Margaret her mother [‘Vahalt
uerch y Moel Cólóm, brenhin Prydein’&mdash;&#8203;another manuscript more
reasonably has ‘y Pictieit’&mdash;&#8203;‘o Vargaret urenhines y mam’]. And
she, by his marrying her, was raised to the rank of queen; for
William Rufus [Gúilim Goch] his brother, in his lifetime, had consorted
with concubines, and on that account had died without an
heir.” <abbr title="Compare">Cf.</abbr> <a href="#Page_503"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 503.</a></p>

<p class="p2">I have said, what is perfectly true, that Orderic is the only writer
who directly mentions that Matilda had once borne the name of
Eadgyth. But I think that I have lighted on a most curious trace
of the fact in a later writer. Peter Langtoft (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 448) mentions the
return of Robert, and adds;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0a">“La femme le duk Robert fu en proteccioun</div>
<div class="i0">Le counte de Cornewaylle, fillye [fu] Charloun</div>
<div class="i0">Seygnur de Cecylle, Egyth la dame ad noun;</div>
<div class="i0">Robert la prent e mene à sa possessioun.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>The name appears in various spellings in different manuscripts,
Edgith, Egdith, and what not. It was perhaps not very wonderful
that, in Peter Langtoft’s day, a Count of Conversana should grow
into a lord of Sicily, and that a lord of Sicily should be thought to
be of necessity called Charles. But why should Sibyl be turned
into Edith? I can think of no reason except that the next
lines are;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="unindent">Surely the poet had read somewhere that Matilda had been called
Edith, and then mixed up her and Sibyl together. But why Sibyl
should be in the protection of the “Count of Cornwall”&mdash;&#8203;meaning,
if anybody, William of Mortain&mdash;&#8203;it is not easy to see. Had he
read in Orderic (784 B, C) that Robert and Sibyl went together to
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“mons sancti Michaelis archangeli de periculo maris,”</span> and took it

<p class="center sc">The Treaty of 1101.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I do</span> not know that there is any necessary contradiction between
the detailed narrative of Orderic (788), who alone speaks of the personal
interview between the brothers, and the shorter accounts of the
other writers, who have more to say about the action of the wise
men on each side. Nothing is more likely than that the terms
of the treaty should be discussed by commissioners on both sides,
and then finally agreed on in a personal meeting of the two princes.
The only point of difficulty is that Orderic seems to imply that
nobody on either side could be trusted, except the princes themselves.
He begins with Henry’s message to ask why Robert had
entered his kingdom (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“cur Angliæ fines cum armato exercitu
intrare præsumpserit”</span>). Robert’s answer reminds one of the
answer of Edward son of Henry the Sixth to Edward the Fourth
(Hall, 301; Lingard, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 189). His words are; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Regnum patris
mei cum proceribus meis ingressus sum, et illud reposco debitum
mihi jure primogenitorum.”</span></p>

<p>The armies are now face to face, and the negotiations begin.
In the Chronicle the reconcilation clearly seems to be the work
of the head men; “Ac þa heafod men heom betwenan foran and
þa broðra gesehtodan.” So Florence; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sapientiores utriusque
partis, habito inter se salubri consilio, pacem inter fratres composuere.”</span>
William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 395) adds a special reason
for peace; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Satagentibus sanioris consilii hominibus, qui dicerent
pietatis jus violandum si fraterna necessitudo prælio concurreret,
paci animos accommodavere; reputantes quod, si alter occumberet,
alter infirmior remaneret, cum nullus fratrum præter ipsos superesset.”</span>
<a name="Page_689" id="Page_689"></a><span class="pageno">689</span>
There is here nothing to throw any doubt on the good
faith of anybody, and no negotiators are mentioned by name. It
is Wace (15508 Pluquet, 10423 Andresen) who mentions negotiators
on Robert’s side whom we certainly should not have looked for;</p>

<div class="poem">

</div><!--end poem-->

<p>It is Orderic alone who implies that Henry asked for a personal
interview, and gives his reason;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Seditiosi proditores magis bellum quam pacem optabant. Et
quia plus privatæ quam publicæ commoditati insistebant, versipelles
veredarii verba pervertebant, et magis jurgia quam concordiam
inter fratres serebant. Porro sagax Henricus istud advertit, unde
fratris colloquium ore ad os petiit; et convenientes fraterni amoris
dulcedo ambos implevit.”</p>

<p>He then goes on to describe the meeting of the brothers;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Soli duo germani spectantis in medio populi collocuti sunt,
et ore quod corde ruminabant sine dolo protulerunt. Denique
post pauca verba mutuo amplexati sunt, datisque dulcibus basiis,
sine sequestro concordes effecti sunt. Verba quidem hujus colloquii
nequeo hic inserere, quia non interfui, sed opus, quod de tantorum
consilio fratrum processit, auditu didici.”</p>

<p>He then gives the terms of the treaty, and adds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Remotis omnibus arbitris soli fratres scita sua sanxerunt, et,
cunctis in circumitu eos cum admiratione spectantibus, decreverunt
quod sese, ut decet fratres, invicem adjuvarent, et omnia patris sui
dominia resumerent, scelestosque litium satores pariter utrinque
punirent.”</p>

<p>The colouring of Orderic in these passages can hardly be
reconciled with the other accounts. They clearly speak of the
terms as agreed upon between the chief men of both sides, while
Orderic implies that, on account of their untrustworthiness, the
princes met and settled matters for themselves. But it is possible
<a name="Page_690" id="Page_690"></a><span class="pageno">690</span>
to accept Orderic’s fact without accepting his colouring. Or we
may suppose that there were among the negotiators some who
wished to hinder peace, but that those who laboured for it got the
better in the end. Then, we may suppose, they agreed upon terms,
and the King and the Duke met to ratify the treaty. As for the
terms of the treaty, they are, as usual, given in the best and most
formal way in the Chronicle. The brothers agree,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On þa gerád þet se cyng forlet eall þæt he mid streangðe innan
Normandig togeanes þam eorle heold, and þæt ealle þa on Englelande
heora land ongean heafdon, þe hit ær þurh þone eorl forluron, and
Eustaties eorl eac eall his fæderland her on lande, and þet se eorl
Rotbert ælce geare sceolde of Englalande þreo þusend marc seolfres
habban, and loc hweðer þæra gebroðra oðerne oferbide wære
yrfeweard ealles Englalandes and eac Normandiges, buton se forðfarena
yrfenuman heafde be rihtre æwe.”</p>

<p>Florence says nothing about the mutual succession of the two
brothers, nor does he mention Eustace by name. He also leaves
out the cession of Henry’s Norman dominions;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Pacem inter fratres ea ratione composuere ut <abbr title="3">iii.</abbr> mille marcas,
id est <abbr title="2000"><span class="muchsmaller">MM.</span></abbr> libras argenti, singulis annis rex persolveret comiti, et
omnibus suos pristinos honores quos in Anglia pro comitis fidelitate
perdiderant, restitueret gratuito, et cunctis quibus honores in Normannia
causa regis fuerant ablati, comes redderet absque pretio.”</p>

<p>Nothing in the treaty seems to have struck William of Malmesbury,
except the yearly payment of three thousand marks by the
King to the Duke. And even that he brings in quite incidentally,
as if to account for its being very shortly given up;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sed et trium millium marcarum promissio lenem comitis
fallebat credulitatem, ut, procinctu soluto, de tanta pecunia menti
blandiretur suæ, quam ille posteriori statim anno voluntati reginæ
libens, quod illa peteret, condonavit.”</p>

<p>One is reminded of the story which William elsewhere (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 251)
tells, without any date, of Robert’s friend Eadgar; “Quantula
simplicitas ut libram argenti, quam quotidie in stipendio accipiebat,
regi pro uno equo perdonaret.” No doubt in both cases the horse
and the gift to the Queen were mere decent pretences for stopping
the payment; but the gift to Matilda is quite of a piece with
Robert’s conduct to her at Winchester (see <a href="#Page_406"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 406</a>). The Chronicler
two years later (1103) records Robert’s surrender of his pension;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691"></a><span class="pageno">691</span>
“Ðises geares eac com se eorl Rotbert of Normandig to sprecene
wið þone cyng [the common Domesday form in English] her on
lande, and ær he heonne ferde he forgeaf þa þreo þusend marc þe
him <em>seo cyng</em> Heanrig be foreweard ælce geare gifan sceolde.”</p>

<p>Here we have no mention of Matilda, unless she anyhow lurks
in the feminine article so oddly assigned to her husband.</p>

<p>Orderic helps us to the more distinct resignation by Robert
of his claims on the English crown, which is however implied
in all the other accounts&mdash;&#8203;to the release of Henry from his homage
to Robert&mdash;&#8203;and to the stipulation about Domfront, which was
naturally more interesting to him than it was to those who wrote
in England. He does not mention the mutual heirship of the
brothers. He also confounds marks and pounds;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In primis Rodbertus dux calumniam quam in regno Angliæ
ingesserat fratri dimisit, ipsumque de homagio, quod sibi jamdudum
fecerat, pro regali dignitate absolvit. Henricus autem rex tria
milia librarum sterilensium sese duci redditurum per singulos
annos spopondit, totumque Constantinum pagum et quidquid in
Neustria possidebat, præter Danfrontem, reliquit. Solum Danfrontem
castrum sibi retinuit, quia Danfrontanis, quando illum
intromiserunt, jurejurando pepigerat quod nunquam eos de manu
sua projiceret, nec leges eorum vel consuetudines mutaret.”</p>

<p class="p2">I am glad to end with the mention of one of the noblest spots of
which I have had to speak in my story, and with one of the most
honourable features in the history of King Henry.</p>

<p class="p4 footnote"> <a name="footnote_1" id="footnote_1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_1"><span class="muchsmaller">[1]</span></a>
 In this chapter we have to make more use than usual of the Scottish,
British, and Northumbrian writers. I do not undertake to go very deeply
into any purely literary questions about them. I have simply used them
for facts, and have dealt with their statements according to the usual rules
of criticism. The Scottish and Northumbrian writers will be found in Mr.
Skene’s edition of Fordun and in the Surtees Society’s edition of Simeon.
This last contains, among other things, Turgot’s Life of Saint Margaret and
the passages from Fordun which profess to be extracts from Turgot. The
Surtees’ text and Mr. Skene’s text do not always agree, but their differences
are not often of much importance for my purposes. It is certainly
strange if some of these passages really come from a contemporary writer.
For Welsh matters we are, to my mind, better off. Unhappily I do not
know enough of the Welsh tongue really to make use of the originals,
though I am not utterly at the mercy of the translator as to proper names
and technical terms. In the Chronicles and Memorials are two volumes
of most valuable matter which need a fresh editor. It is not my business
to enter into any questions as to their authorship, how far it is due to
Caradoc of Llancarfan or anybody else. In any case the Latin <cite>Annales
Cambriæ</cite>, meagre as they are, form a thoroughly good and trustworthy
record, but the Editor seems in many places to have been unable either
to read his manuscript or to construe his Latin. Many of the readings too
which are most valuable historically are thrust into notes. The Welsh
<cite>Brut y Tywysogion</cite>, published in the same series by the same Editor, is a
fuller version of the Annals, and also I believe essentially trustworthy. I have
been obliged to quote this in the translation, though often with some doubts
as to its accuracy. In the preface a good deal of matter by the late Mr.
Aneurin Owen is reprinted without acknowledgement. There is also another
<cite>Brut y Tywysogion</cite>, otherwise “The Gwentian Chronicles of Caradoc of
Llancarvan,” translated by Mr. Owen and published by the Cambrian
Archæological Association. Here we have the translating and editing of
a really eminent Welsh scholar, but the book, as a historical authority, is
very inferior to either the Latin Annals or the other Brut. A great deal of
legendary matter, some of which must be of quite a late date, has been
thrust in. I quote the more trustworthy Brut in the Chronicles and
Memorials as the <em>elder</em>, and that published by the Cambrian Archæological
Association as the <em>later</em> Brut.</p>

 So says the Northern interpolator of Florence whom we are used to
call Simeon, 1093; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ecclesia nova Dunelmi est incepta tertio idus Augusti
feria quinta, episcopo Willelmo et Malcholmo rege Scottorum et Turgoto
priore ponentibus primos in fundamento lapides.”</span> Fordun (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 20) says
the same in a passage which purports to come from Turgot, and of which
we shall have to speak again. It is certainly remarkable, as Mr. Hinde
remarks in his note on the passage in the Gesta Regum (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 104), that
in the History of the Church of Durham (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 8) Simeon makes no mention
of Malcolm. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eo die episcopus, et qui post eum secundus erat in ecclesia

 So witnesses Turgot in the chapter just quoted; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Libros in quibus ipsa
vel orare consueverat vel legere, ille, ignarus licet literarum, sæpe manu
versare solebat et inspicere: et dum ab ea quis illorum esset ei carior
audisset, hunc et ipse cariorem habere, deosculari, sæpius contrectare.”</span>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_36" id="footnote_36"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_36"><span class="muchsmaller">[36]</span></a>
 Turgot is of course full on this head throughout, and we have a further
witness from our own Florence (1093) and Orderic (701 D). From the
last we get her bounty to Iona&mdash;&#8203;that barbarous name is more intelligible
than any other. In his words it is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Huense cœnobium quod servus Christi
Columba, tempore Brudei, regis Pictorum, filii Meilocon, construxerat.”</span></p>

 Turgot, in his fourth chapter, enlarges on the strict order which
Margaret kept in her household, especially among her own attendant
ladies. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Inerat enim reginæ tanta cum jocunditate severitas, tanta cum
severitate jocunditas, ut omnes qui erant in ejus obsequio, viri et feminæ,
illam et timendo diligerent et diligendo timerent. Quare in præsentia
ejus non solum nihil execrandum facere, sed ne turpe quidem verbum
quisquam ausus fuerat proferre. Ipsa enim universa in se reprimens
vitia, cum magna gravitate lætabatur, cum magna honestate irascebatur.”</span></p>

 Orderic (703 B, C) has his panegyric on the three brothers, and
specially on David; but it is William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 400) who is
especially emphatic on the unparalleled purity of life of all three. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Neque

 Three parties are clearly described by Mr. E. W. Robertson, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 155.
There were the remnants of the partisans of the house of Moray, the house
of Macbeth, the party of the North, and the partisans of the reigning house,
divided into a strictly Scottish and an English party. The success of
Donald must have been owing to a momentary union of the first two of
these parties. I hardly know what to make of the statement in the Turgot
extracts (Simeon, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 262) that Donald arose <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“auxilio regis Norwegiæ.”</span></p>

with a general remark on the pride and greediness of the Normans who had
received large estates in England. He then describes their dissatisfaction
with the rule of William Rufus in words which are not altogether discreditable
to the King; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Invidebant quippe et dolebant quod Guillelmus Rufus
audacia et probitate præcipue vigeret, nullumque timens subjectis omnibus

in the case of Robert of Mowbray we shall find him doing justice&mdash;&#8203;were
both dealt out without respect of persons. Orderic does not specially mention
the hunting-laws; but William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 319) speaks of their
harshness, and adds, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quapropter multa severitate quam nulla condiebat

them; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Farne dicitur insula medio in mari posita, quæ non,
sicut Lindisfarnensium incolarum regio, bis quotidie accedente æstu oceani,
quem rheuma vocant Græci, fit insula, bis renudatis abeunte rheumate littoribus

 The vision of Boso fills the ninth chapter of the fourth book of Simeon’s
Durham history. He sees first, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Per campum latissimum totius hujus provinciæ
indigenas congregatos, qui equis admodum pinguibus sedentes, et
longas, sicut soliti sunt, hastas portantes, earumque collisione magnum
facientes strepitum, multa ferebantur superbia.”</span> One might have taken
these mounted spearmen for Normans; but we read, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Multo majori
quam priores superbia secuti sunt Francigenæ, qui et ipsi frementibus equis
subvecti et universo armorum genere induti, equorum frementium sonitu
et armorum collisione immanem late faciebant tumultum.”</span> Lastly came
the worst class of all; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Deinde per extensum aliquot miliariis campum
innumeram feminarum multitudinem intueor, quarum tantam turbam dum
admirarer, eas presbyterorum uxores esse a ductore meo didici. Has,
inquit, miserabiles et illos qui ad sacrificandum Deo consecrati sunt, nec
tamen illecebris carnalibus involvi metuerunt, væ sempiternum et gehennalium
flammarum atrocissimus expectat cruciatus.”</span> But how vast must
have been the number of priests in the bishopric, if their wives, seemingly
not on horseback, filled up so much room. The monks of Durham,
on the other hand, were seen in a beautiful flowery plain, all except two
sinners, whose names are not given, but who were to be reported to the
Prior in order that they might repent.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_127" id="footnote_127"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_127"><span class="muchsmaller">[127]</span></a>
 The nature of the omen does not seem very clear; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In loco vastæ ac
tetræ solitudinis, magna altitudine domum totam ex ferro fabrifactam
aspexi, cujus janua dum sæpius aperiretur sæpiusque clauderetur, ecce
subito episcopus Willelmus efferens caput, ubinam Gosfridus monachus
esset a me quæsivit.”</span> This monk Geoffrey must surely be the same as the
one we heard of before as concerned in Bishop William’s former troubles
(see <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 116). This gives the confirmation of an undesigned coincidence
to that story.</p>

 It is curious that, while the Durham writer implies the summons by
the use of the word “placitum” in the account of Boso’s vision, he gives
no account of the summons in his own narrative. The gap is filled up by
William of Malmesbury, <abbr title="Gestis Pontificum">Gest. Pont.</abbr> 273; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Non multo post orto inter ipsum
et regem discidio, ægritudine procubuit apud Gloecestram. Ibi tunc erat
curia, et jussus est episcopus exhiberi, ut causam suam defensaret.”</span> The
place of King William’s sickness in 1093 is here confounded with the place
of Bishop William’s sickness in 1096. But Gloucester was the right place
for holding the Gemót, though it was held at Windsor.</p>

wrong, as the castle of Pembroke appears both in the Annales Cambriæ

as in being soon after the death of Rhys ap Tewdwr. He perhaps confounds
Arnulf’s first rude work with the stronger castle built by Gerald

 Brut y Tywysogion, 1092 (1094). The translation runs; “Whilst
William remained in Normandy, the Britons resisted the domination of the
French, not being able to bear their cruelty, and demolished their castles in
Gwynedd, and <em>iterated</em> their depredations and slaughters among them.” The
Latin annalist says only; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Britanni jugum Francorum respuerunt. Wenedociam,
Cereticam et Demetiam ab iis et eorum castellis <em>emundaverunt</em>.”</span>
Both these writers have oddly mistaken the state of things in Normandy.
One manuscript of the Annales says that William went into Normandy, and
that the revolt happened, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ibi morante et fratrem suum expugnante,”</span> while
the Brut says more wildly that “King William Rufus [Gwilim Goch], who
first by a most glorious war prevailed over the Saxons, went to Normandy to
keep and defend the kingdom [teyrnas] of Robert his brother, who had gone
to Jerusalem [Kærcesalem] to fight against the Saracens and other barbarous
nations and to protect the Christians, and to acquire greater fame.”</p>

 I have no better direct authority for this than the later Brut, which

<a href="#fnanchor_253"><span class="muchsmaller">[253]</span></a>
 This is from the same entry in the later Brut. After mentioning the
castles, it is added that Harry Beaumont “established himself there and
brought Saxons from Somersetshire [Saeson o wlad yr Haf] there, where
they obtained lands; and the greatest usurpation of all the Frenchmen
was his in Gower.” Nothing can be made of this writer’s dates, even when
we accept his facts with a little trembling.</p>

 This account comes only from the younger Brut (79). It is in fact
part of the legend of the conquest of Glamorgan. But that legend, as we

in well with the general course of events. The men of Morganwg and
Gwaenllwg&mdash;&#8203;that is the modern Wentloog, the land between Rhymny and
Usk&mdash;&#8203;rose and destroyed the castle, Pagan of Turberville leading them.</p>

 These details of the siege of Pembroke come from Giraldus, <abbr title="Itinerarium Cambriae one">It. Camb.
i.</abbr> 12. As he has mistaken the date of the whole matter by putting it in
the reign of Henry, so he has mistaken the special date of the siege, which
he places soon after the death of Rhys ap Tewdwr, that is in 1093. His
stories may belong to the movement of 1094; but they seem to come more
naturally here. When the knights have deserted, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ex desperatione scapham
intrantes navigio fugam attemptassent, in crastino mane Giraldus eorum
armigeris arma dominorum cum feodis dedit, ipsosque statim militari cingulo

the besieged castle; otherwise it is not clear how the Welsh could have got

 The Brut here waxes so spirited that one is sorry not to have a better
knowledge of the original. “The French dared not penetrate the rocks and
the woods, but hovered about the level plains. At length they returned
home empty, without having gained anything; and the Britons, happy and
unintimidated, defended their country.” The Annals say, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Willelmus rex
Angliæ secundo in Britones excitatur, eorum omnium minans excidium;
Britones vero divino protecti munimine in sua remanent illæsi, rege

 There is no need to go through all the details. The strangest is when the

 They are “Hugi Prúdi oc Hugi Digri” in the Saga (Johnstone, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 234).
In the younger Brut, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 84, the earls are called “Huw iarll Caerllion a

The elder Brut confounds the two earls. The bulk of Earl Hugh of Chester

The date of the original building cannot be very far off either way from
the times with which we are dealing. The tower-windows are a kind of
transition from Primitive Romanesque to Norman. A doorway of later

 A singular story is preserved in Bromton (X Scriptt. 988). When
Earl Roger’s second and better-behaved wife Adeliza was coming for the
first time to England, she was in danger of shipwreck. Her chaplain, who
was on board, had a vision, in which a certain matron told him that, in
order to lull the storm, his lady must vow to build a church to Saint Mary
Magdalene on the spot where she should first meet her husband, a spot
which was to be marked in a manner not unknown either at Glastonbury
or at Alba Longa; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Præcipue ubi concava quercus cum tugurio porcorum
crescit.”</span> The vow is made; the Countess meets the Earl hunting; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“apud
Quatford, quæ tunc deserta fuit, in loco ubi dicta quercus crescebat venanti
domino suo primo occurrit.”</span> The church was founded and endowed; but
it afterwards became annexed to the collegiate chapel in the castle at
Bridgenorth. Some further details about this college are given. See also
<abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum">Mon. Angl.</abbr> <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 1463. The foundation at Bridgenorth is attributed to
Robert of Bellême.</p>

 I have not myself seen this site. Mr. Clark writes to me; “The
township of that name is within the Shropshire parish of Llan y-mynech
but a part of an island of Denbigh. The site, coveted on account of some
silver mines, was conquered soon after the Great Survey, and annexed to
the palatine earldom of Salop, though after the conquest of Wales it was
transferred to Denbigh. The castle stood upon Offa’s Dyke, and was protected
on the immediate south by the Vyrnwy, and a mile or two to the west by
its tributary the Tarrat. Three British camps to the north and west
show how at least as early as the Mercian days the position had been
watched.”</p>

 I have had to mention Blyth in my paper on the Arundel case in the
Archæological Journal, <abbr title="thirty-seven">xxxvii.</abbr> 244 (1880). The monastic part at the east
end is gone, and the effect of the parochial part strangely changed by
later additions. No one would think from the first glance at the outside
that the nave of a Norman minster lurked there.</p>

<p class="footnote">There are two notices of Blyth in the Normanniæ Nova Chronica under
1088 and 1090. The first merely records a grant of the church to the Trinity
monastery (also called Saint Katharine) at Rouen; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“a viro venerabili Rogerio
de Bully et ab Munold [sic] uxore sua.”</span> The second records the gift a second
time, and adds, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ibi constituit <abbr title="13">xiii.</abbr> monachos.”</span> He had had dealings with
the house before. In the cartulary of the monastery, <abbr title="Number 43 page">No. xliii. p.</abbr> 444, he
sells the tithe of Bully [Buslei], <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quemadmodum sibi jure hæreditario competebat,”</span>
for threescore and twelve pounds and a horse (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pro libris denariorum
<abbr title="40">lx.</abbr> et <abbr title="12">xii.</abbr> et <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> equo”</span>). The signatures, besides those of Duke William
and Count Robert of Eu, are mainly local, as <span  lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hernaldi cujus pars decimæ,”</span>
“Huelini de Brincourt,”&mdash;Neufchâtel that was to be. Mr. A. S. Ellis suggests
that this sale was to supply the lord of Bully with the means of crossing
in 1066. It is odd that there is no mention of Blyth in the cartulary.</p>

 The authorities for this chapter take in such French and Cenomannian
records as we have. Suger’s Life of Lewis the Sixth, in the fourth volume
of the French Duchèsne, gives us but few facts as to the French war, but
he draws a vivid general picture. For Maine we have the Lives of Bishops
Howel and Hildebert in the History of the Bishops of Le Mans in Mabillon’s
Vetera Analecta. The accounts there given have to be compared
throughout with the narrative of the French and Cenomannian wars in
Orderic. The strictly English writers tell us nothing about France, next to
nothing about Maine. Something may be gleaned from the writers in
French rime, as Wace and Geoffrey Gaimar; but Wace has by no means
the same value now which he had during the actual time of the Conquest.</p>

 William of Malmesbury tells the story (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 257); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Pacem cum Philippo
rege comparavit [Robertus Friso], data sibi in uxorem privigna, de qua
ille Lodovicum tulit qui modo regnat in Francia; nec multo post pertæsus
connubii (quod illa præpinguis corpulentiæ esset), a lecto removit, uxoremque
Andegavensis comitis contra fas et jus sibi conjunxit.”</span> The reason
here given for separation seems a strange one, especially on the part of
Philip. Henry the Eighth, according to some accounts, is said at one stage
to have sought for a wife of his own size. The Queen appears in Orderic
(699 B) as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“generosa et religiosa conjux.”</span> It appears from Geoffrey Malaterra
(<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 8) that Philip next wished to marry Emma, the daughter of Count
Robert of Sicily; but the trick was found out. It was not easy to entrap
a Sicilian Norman.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_436" id="footnote_436"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_436"><span class="muchsmaller">[436]</span></a>
 This is Orderic’s story. The three wives of Fulk are carefully reckoned
up in the Gesta Consulum (Chroniques d’Anjou, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 140) and in the Gesta
Ambasiensium Dominorum (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 191). Bertrada therefore had some reason
when we read, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Bertrada Andegavorum comitissa, metuens ne vir suus
quod jam duabus aliis fecerat sibi faceret, et relicta contemptui ceu vile
scortum fieret, conscia nobilitatis et pulcritudinis suæ fidissimum legatum
Philippo regi Francorum destinavit, eique quod in corde tractabat, evidenter
notificavit. Malebat enim ultro virum relinquere aliumque appetere quam a
viro relinqui, omniumque patere despectui.”</span> Some details of the elopement
of Bertrada from Tours are given in the Gesta Consulum, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 142, and in the
acts of the Lords of Amboise, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 192. She appears there as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“pessima uxor
Fulconis comitis.”</span></p>

 William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 404) lays the blame in a quarter which we
should not have looked for; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Adeo erat [Philippus] omnibus episcopis provinciæ
suæ derisui, ut nullus eos desponsaret præter Willelmum archiepiscopum
Rotomagensem, cujus facti temeritatem luit multis annis interdictus,
et vix tandem aliquando per Anselmum archiepiscopum apostolicæ communioni
redditus.”</span> (See De Rémusat, Anselme, 355.) It is hard to have to
believe this of the Good Soul, and one rather takes to Orderic’s version
(699 C); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Odo Baiocensis episcopus hanc exsecrandam desponsationem
fecit, ideoque dono mœchi regis pro recompensatione infausti famulatus
ecclesias Madanti oppidi aliquamdiu habuit.”</span> Orderic waxes very eloquent
on Philip’s crime.</p>

 See his letters in Duchèsne, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 2, 3, 4, 7. Ivo distinctly refuses to have
anything to do with the marriage; but it seems that Philip pretended to
have been divorced by a council under Reginald Archbishop of Rheims.</p>

 I am here following Orderic, whose account (683 D) runs thus; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Interea
dum per diocesim suam cum clericis suis equitaret, et episcopali more
officium suum sollerter exerceret, Helias de Flechia eum comprehendit,
et in carcere, donec Hugo in urbe Cenomannica susceptus fuisset, vinctum
præsulem tenuit.”</span> The biographer of the Bishop (Vet. An. 291) is of
course much more angry with Helias, and seems quite to misconceive the
state of things. Very soon after the death of the Conqueror, Helias seizes
Ballon and makes war on Le Mans; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Surrexit quidam nobilis adolescens, qui
erat de genere Cenomannensium consulum, Helias nomine, et cœpit calumniari
ipsum comitatum, ingressusque castrum quod Baledonem nominant,
regionem undique devastabat, maximeque adversus civitatis habitatores, qui
ei viriliter resistebant, multis insidiis assiduisque deprædationibus grassabatur.”</span>
The Bishop opposes him in the interest of Duke Robert, and then,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quorumdam perversorum consilio, in tantam prorupit audaciam ut in
christum Domini manum mittere, eumque apud castrum patrimonii sui,
quod Fissa dicitur, in custodia ponere non timeret.” “Fissa”</span> is La Flèche.
This writer says nothing of the message to Hugh till after the imprisonment
of Howel. It is then set on foot by Geoffrey of Mayenne, who is
described as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ratus se opportunum tempus invenisse, quo regionem denuo
perturbaret.”</span> We must remember that Orderic is here writing the history
of Maine, while the biographer is merely writing the history of Howel; but
for that very reason we may trust him as to the details of the Bishop’s
imprisonment.</p>

sanctas imagines cum crucibus, et sanctarum scrinia reliquiarum, ad
terram deposuit, et portas basilicarum spinis obturavit.”</span> The biographer
of the Bishops mentions only the thorns, and he seems to imply that only
Le Mans and its suburbs were thus treated; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Matris ecclesiæ omniumque
ejusdem civitatis vel suburbii ecclesiarum januas.”</span></p>

homage to the new prince, much as Henry the First, as we shall see in a later
chapter, demanded the homage of Anselm. Howel’s objection seems simply
to be that Robert was the lawful lord, not that it was unlawful to accept
the benefice from any temporal lord.</p>

 The troubles of the Bishop are set forth at length by his biographer
(Vet. An. 292 <abbr title="et sequentia">et seqq.</abbr>). This device of his enemies in the Chapter was
the cruellest of all. Finding no fault in him, but wishing that some fault
should be found, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“sub specie veræ amicitiæ persuaserunt ei ut fraterculum
duodennem qui necdum perfecte litterarum elementa didicerat, in ejus [decani]
loco constitueret, et contra ecclesiastica instituta inductum prudentibus
puerulum senioribus anteferret.”</span> Geoffrey was a Breton, brother
of Judicail&mdash;&#8203;the name familiar in so many spellings&mdash;&#8203;Bishop of Saint Malo.
See <abbr title="Orderic Vitalis">Ord. Vit.</abbr> 770 C. There was much disputing between him and the
other candidate for the deanery. This was Gervase, nephew of the former
Bishop Gervase (see <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume three page">N. C. vol. iii. p.</abbr> 193), who had on his side the memory
of his uncle, and the special favour of his brothers with Count Hugh (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quia

“vincula,” like Orderic’s own “carcer” in 771 B, is a vague kind of word

cognomento Richinus, Andegavorum comes, ut Heliam captum audivit,
Cænomannis, <em>quia capitalis dominus erat</em>, actutum advenit, et a civibus
libenter susceptus, munitiones militibus et fundibulariis munivit.”</span> The
local writer (Vet. An. 305) is silent about Fulk’s lordship, but remembers
the family connexion between him and Helias; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quo comperto, Fulco Andegavorum
comes protinus cum filio suo Gaufrido, cui filia Heliæ comitis
jam desponsata fuerat, in civitatem advenit, et consensu civium in munitionibus

a formal act of the municipal body.</p>

a drawn battle by daylight, and mentions the occupation of Ballon; but
they both agree in the main fact that Rufus, for whatever cause, withdrew
from before Le Mans for a season. Ballon is spoken of as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“fortissima mota,

 Orderic (773 D), immediately after recording the submission of the
Cenomannian castles, goes on to draw a harrowing picture of the sufferings
of England during the King’s absence; how <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rannulfus Flambardus
jam Dunelmi episcopus, aliique regis satellites et gastaldi, Angliam
spoliabant, et latronibus pejores, agricolarum acervos, ac negotiatorum
congeries immisericorditer diripiebant, nec etiam sanguinolentas manus
a sacris cohibebant.”</span> He then goes on to describe the special wrongs
of the Church, and adds, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sic immensi census onera per fas perque nefas
coacervabant, et regi trans fretum, ut in nefariis seu commodis usibus
expenderentur, destinabant. Hujusmodi utique collectionibus grandia regi
xenia præsentabantur, quibus extranei pro vana laude ditabantur.”</span> They
then cried to God who had raised up Ehud to slay the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“rex pinguissimus”</span>
Eglon, which sounds rather like a prayer for the coming of Walter Tirel. But
the chronology is utterly confused. The time of which Orderic is speaking
is the year 1098; yet he makes Flambard already Bishop of Durham, which
he was not till 1099, and he makes Anselm withstand all these oppressions
and go away because he could not hinder them. But, as we well know,
Anselm was already gone in 1097.</p>

<p class="footnote">Henry of Huntingdon also (<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 20) notices the special oppression during
the continental war. The King <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in Normannia fuit, semper hosticis

pessimis populos Anglorum non abradens sed excorians.”</span></p>

suo fieri permittebat, sed provincias intolerabiliter vexabat in tributis
quæ numquam cessabant, in opere muri circa turrim Londoniæ, in opere
aulæ regalis apud Westminstre, in rapina quam familia sua hostili modo,
ubicunque rex pergebat, exercebant.”</span> The other side of the story comes
out in William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 321); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Unum ædificium, et ipsum
permaximum, domum in Londonia incepit et perfecit, non parcens
expensis dummodo liberalitatis suæ magnificentiam exhiberet.”</span> We see
here how the “liberalitas” of the Red King looked in the eyes of those
who had to pay for it. But it is hard to understand Sir T. D. Hardy’s
note on the passage of William of Malmesbury; he is speaking not of the
Tower of London, but of Westminster Hall.</p>

 The Chronicler (1098) records the deaths of Walkelin, Baldwin,
and Turold. Florence (1097, 1098) adds that of Robert, and in one
manuscript that of Abbot Reginald of Abingdon, who (<abbr title="Historia de Abingdon two">Hist. Ab. ii.</abbr> 42)
would seem to have died somewhat earlier, in the year 1097. This prelate
is said to have been in the King’s good graces, and to have been employed
by him in the pious and charitable distribution from his father’s hoard
at the beginning of his reign (see <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 17). There is also just before in
the local History (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 41) a writ of Rufus to Peter Sheriff of Oxfordshire,
witnessed by Randolf the chaplain, in which the Sheriff is bidden to let
the Abbot and his monks enjoy all that they had <abbr title="Tempore Regis Edwardi">T. R. E.</abbr> and <abbr title="Tempore Regis Willelmi">T. R. W.</abbr>,
and specially to make good the wrongs done by his reeve Eadwig and

gone through endless corruptions, see Liebermann’s note (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ungedruckte
Anglo-Normannische Geschichtsquellen</span>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 277) to Heremann’s Miracles of
Saint Eadmund. William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="Gestis Pontificum">Gest. Pont.</abbr> 156) writes him
“Germinus,” and not unnaturally says that he knows very little about
him, save that he was brother of Saint Æthelthryth. His editor turns
him into Saint German of Auxerre; he then wonders that William should
know so little of Saint German of whom he had found a good deal to say
elsewhere, but he does not himself seem the least surprised to hear Saint
German spoken of as brother of Saint Æthelthryth.</p>

 See <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume five page">N. C. vol. v. p.</abbr> 631. But it would seem from the words of the
biographer (X Scriptt. 62; <abbr title="Anglia Sacra two">Ang. Sac. ii.</abbr> 709) that the work was not quite
finished till after his death; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eo tempore</span> [in the five years’ vacancy that
followed] <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">navis ecclesiæ Dunelmensis monachis operi instantibus peracta
est.”</span> This can hardly mean the vault, which seems later still. The
biographer also describes his other local works, specially how <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“urbem
hanc, licet natura munierit, muro ipse reddidit fortiorem et augustiorem.”</span>
William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="Gestis Pontificum">Gest. Pont.</abbr> 274) records new buildings for the

 The biographer (<abbr title="ut sequitur">u. s.</abbr>) says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Condidit castellum in excelso præruptæ
rupis super Twedam flumen, ut inde latronum incursus inhiberet et
Scotorum irruptiones. Ibi enim, <em>utpote in confinio regni Anglorum et
Scotorum</em>, creber prædantibus ante patebat incursus, nullo ibidem quo
hujusmodi impetus repelleretur præsidio locato.”</span> From Simeon’s Gesta
Regum we find that the place was Norham and the date 1121. The words
in Italics should be noticed. By the time of this writer the older position
of Lothian was beginning to be forgotten; it had passed to Northumberland.
The building of the castle suggests to the biographer a remark on Flambard’s
character; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Taliter impulsu quodam impatiente otii de opere transibat
ad opus, nil reputans factum, nisi factis nova jam facienda succederent.”</span></p>

<a href="#fnanchor_668"><span class="muchsmaller">[668]</span></a>
 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Inerat ei episcopo <em>magnanimitas</em> quam quondam procurator regni

 According to William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="Gestis Pontificum">Gest. Pont.</abbr> 274), he first behaved
well for fear of Saint Cuthberht, but finding that some smaller
misdeeds went unpunished, he presently ventured on greater. But in the
existing text he mentions only that Flambard dragged criminals out of sanctuary,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ausus scelus omnibus retro annis inauditum.”</span> William had written,
but he found it expedient to strike out, how the Bishop not only set forbidden
food before his monks, but, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ut magis religionem irritaret, puellas speciosissimas
quæ essent procatioris formæ et faciei eis propinare juberet, strictis
ad corpus vestibus, solutis in terga crinibus.”</span></p>

Among other confessions of sin, the Bishop says. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“plus volui illis nocere

 Of the two bridges side by side, the elder is useless, two arches having

These two accounts seem to place the fighting on different sides of the
river. I incline to Orderic’s version on this ground. A version which
carries men across by a ford is always to be preferred to one which carries
them across by a bridge, as likely to preserve the older tradition. The
bridge may always have been built between the time of the event and
the time of the writer, and he may easily be led to speak as if it had
been there at the earlier time. Orderic himself speaks of the bridge in
775 B.</p>

 The work of destruction which has been done in modern times at
Paris and Rouen seems a trifle compared to the merciless havoc wrought at
Le Mans. It amounts almost to a physical destruction of the city. The
hill has been cut through to make a road from the modern part of the
town to the river. This has involved breaking through the Roman walls,
cutting through the <em>Vielle Rome</em> and the other ancient streets, sweeping
away the finest of the Romanesque houses, dividing in short the hill and
the ancient city into two parts severed by a yawning gap. The mediæval
wall has further been broken down and made into a picturesque ruin.
When I was first at Le Mans in 1868, the city was still untouched; in
1876 the havoc was doing; by 1879 it was done. Some conceited mayor
or prefect doubtless looks on all this brutal destruction as a noble exploit.</p>

that I must withdraw that praise, as here the word can only mean a plain.
See Ducange in Epitumum. It must be from this word that some local

 There is nothing special to note as to the authorities for this chapter.
Our main story still comes from the same sources from which it has long
come. Possibly the importance of Orderic, long growing, grows yet greater
at the very end of our tale. And we still make a certain use of Wace.
The story of the death of William Rufus is one of those in which it
is desirable to look in all manner of quarters to which we should not commonly
think of turning, not so much in search of facts, as to see how such
a story impressed men’s minds, and what forms it took in various hands.</p>

 The portrait of Sibyl is drawn by William of Malmesbury, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 389,
where she appears as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Filia Willelmi de Conversana, quam rediens in
Apuliam duxerat, cujus elegantissimæ speciei prodigium vix ullius disertitudinis
explicabit conatus.”</span> So Orderic, 780 A; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hæc nimirum bonis
moribus floruit, et multis honestatibus compta, his qui noverant illam
amabilis extitit.”</span> The continuator of William of Jumièges (<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 14) goes
further; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Fuit vero prædicta comitissa pulcra facie, honesta moribus,
sapientia præclara, et aliquando absente duce ipsa melius per se negotia
provinciæ, tam privata quam publica, disponebat, quam ipse faceret si
adesset.”</span> Wace (15422) calls her Sebire, and speaks only of her personal
beauty. She was the mother of William Clito who plays so conspicuous
a part in Henry’s reign. According to William of Malmesbury she died
at his birth in 1103, but Orderic (810 A) tells a strange story how she
was poisoned by Agnes the widow of the old Earl Walter Giffard, who
hoped to marry the Duke. The more general statement in the continuation
of William of Jumièges is to the same effect.</p>

 The consecration and the bishops who had a hand in it are recorded
by Florence, 1100. But he does not mention the other Gloucester stories;
these come from Orderic, who does not mention the consecration. The
two accounts thus fit in to one another. We see why the monks of Gloucester
should be in a special fit of exalted devotion.</p>

 William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 333) describes the process with some

ictu sanguinem emittere, radium cruoris in cælum usque protentum
lucem obnubilare, diem interpolare.”</span> But the common word for being
bled is “minuere” (see Ducange in voc.), and the many monastic rules
which forbid the practice of bleeding except at stated times would seem
to imply that the process, if not liked in itself, was at least made use of
as an excuse for idleness.</p>

 Orderic (782 D) says that they brought his body, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“veluti ferocem
aprum venabulis confossum.”</span> We get the same idea a little improved in
William of Newburgh (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 2), who says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quippe <em>in venatione sagitta
proprii militis</em> homo ferocissimus pro fera confossus interiit.”</span> (The
words in Italics must be a translation of the Chronicle.) The full
developement comes in Thomas Wykes (<abbr title="Annales monastici four">Ann. Mon. iv.</abbr> 13), who must
surely have had William of Newburgh before him. He, like Giraldus
and others (see above, <a href="#Page_322"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 322</a>), looked on Rufus as the maker of the New
Forest, if not as the inventor of forests in general. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex Willelmus
Angliæ, dictus Rufus, qui pro eo quod accipitrum et canum ludicris quasi

equally easy to say that the story is a mere fable suggested by what

any guesses that we think good.</p>

 The speed with which events happened is strongly marked by the

Winceastre Willelme Giffarde geaf, and siþþan to Lundene for.” The
appointment is also recorded by Florence and Henry of Huntingdon.

 Maurice is mentioned as the consecrator by Orderic, 783 B, and by
the Chronicler. Orderic is wrong when he gives as a reason not
only that Anselm was absent, but that Thomas of York was dead. But
he was hard to get at, and as he died three months later, he may very
likely have been sick. On the alleged consecration by Thomas, see

the charter published the same day was its first fulfilment. These special

is important. Orderic (783 C, D) takes the opportunity for an elaborate
panegyric on Henry and his reign. He had already (782 D), before
William is buried, said, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hoc antea dudum fuit a Britonibus prophetatum,

year. They have much to tell of the troubles of the abbey during the
vacancy at the hands of Flambard (Stewart, 276&ndash;283). But it seems that
Flambard needed to be stirred up by a local enemy, who, we are sorry to

 Orderic (783 C, D) mentions all these appointments to abbeys
along with the appointment of William Giffard to Winchester and that
of Gerard to York. It will be remembered that he fancied that Archbishop
Thomas was dead before the coronation. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eliense cœnobium dedit
Ricardo, Ricardi de Benefacta filio, Beccensi monacho, et abbatiam
Sancti Edmundi regis et martyris Rodberto juveni Uticensi monacho,
Hugonis Cestrensis comitis filio. Glastoniam quoque commisit Herluino
Cadomensi, et Habundoniam Farisio Malmesburiensi.”</span> That the appointments
were made on the day of the coronation appears from the two local
histories, the Annals of Saint Eadmund’s in Liebermann, 130, and the two
Ely histories, that in Anglia Sacra, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 613, and the Liber Eliensis (Stewart,
284), which largely copies Florence. As Richard the second Earl of Chester
was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“filius unicus Hugonis consulis”</span> (<abbr title="Henry of Huntingdon">Hen. Hunt.</abbr> De Contemptu Mundi,
304), and as Orderic (787 C) calls him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Pulcherrimus puer, quem solum ex

that Abbot Robert was one of the many natural children of Earl Hugh.

 Orderic, as we have seen, calls Abbot Richard a son of Richard of
Bienfaite, while the Ely writers call him the son of Count Gilbert, which
must be wrong. Yet they have much to say about his family, who are
oddly spoken of as the “Ricardi,” along with the “Gifardi.” They tell
at length the story of his deposition, but attribute it to the King rather
than to Anselm. But see Florence, 1102; Eadmer, 67; <abbr title="Anselm Epistles three">Ans. Ep. iii.</abbr> 140.</p>

 Faricius fills a large space in the history of his abbey. He was a
native of Arezzo, and had been cellarer at Malmesbury; <abbr title="Historia de Abingdon">Hist. Ab.</abbr> <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 44,

 William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 393) puts the whole story emphatically
enough; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ne quid profecto gaudio accumulato abesset, <em>Rannulfo nequitiarum
fæce</em> tenebris ergastularibus incluso, propter Anselmum pernicibus
nuntiis directum.”</span> Florence also joins the imprisonment of Flambard and
the recall of Anselm; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nec multo post Dunholmensem episcopum Rannulfum
Lundoniæ in turri custodiæ mancipavit, et Dorubernensem archiepiscopum
Anselmum de Gallia revocavit.”</span> In the Chronicle we get the
Tower named in our own tongue, as in 1097; “And se cyng sona æfter
þam be þære ræde þe him abutan wæran, þone biscop Rannulf of Dunholme
let niman, and into þam Ture on Lundene lét gebringon and þær healdan.”</p>

not about Helias. It is taken from a letter of Hildebert himself (Duchesne,
<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 279), who speaks of Rotrou as “in vinculis.” We find that Count
Rotrou’s mother gave the Bishop the kiss of peace, which the Lady Eadgyth

 It was held by the new grantee and his son till it was got back from
King Henry by Abbot Faricius (<abbr title="Historia de Abingdon">Hist. Ab.</abbr> <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 288), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“retracto inde ecclesiæ
in hoc temporis spatio servitii omni genere”</span> (<abbr title="Ibid two">Ib. ii.</abbr> 37). This seems to
be the Sparsholt of which I spoke in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 726, as being held by
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Godricus unus liber homo,”</span> a different person from Godric the Sheriff. He
is distinguished in the Abingdon History (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 477) as “Godricus Cild,” and
his Sparsholt is said to be <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“juxta locum qui vulgo Mons Albi Æqui nuncupatur.”</span>
In Domesday (59) we find Anschil holding Sparsholt of the Abbot.
It had been held <abbr title="Tempore Regis Edwardi">T. R. E.</abbr> by Eadric. Eadric and Godric are clearly the
same man, and there must be a mistake of name in one place or the other,
just as in Domesday, 146, <em>Ead</em>wine Abbot of Westminster is miscalled
<em>God</em>wine. But a most curious entry follows, from which it appears that
Eadric or Godric had given the lordship for the support of his son as a
monk in the abbey as long as he lived, after which it was to come back
to himself. The shire therefore threw a doubt on the right of the abbey to
its possession. They had seen no writ or seal of King William granting
it to the abbey; but the abbot and all his monks produced a writ and seal
of King Eadward, from which it appeared that Eadric had given the
manor to the abbey; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Abbas testatur quod in <abbr title="Tempore Regis Edwardi">T. R. E.</abbr> misit ille manerium
ad ecclesiam <em>unde erat</em>, et inde habet brevem et sigillum R. E. attestantibus
omnibus monachis suis.”</span> The words “unde erat” show that Eadric or
Godric held the lordship of the abbey (for its possession of Sparsholt see
<abbr title="Historia de Abingdon">Hist. Ab.</abbr> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 283, 478), but that he gave up his rights in it to the church.
It was then again granted to Anskill.</p>

Reginald, who succeeded Æthelhelm in 1083. As Reginald died in 1097

 Sir Francis Palgrave (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 366), countersigned by Dean Church, Anselm,
243, assures us that “Edith was very beautiful.” Mr. Robertson (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 153,
note) will not allow that she was more than “rather pretty.” The
Abbess in Hermann of Tournay witnesses to her beauty at the age of
twelve, but all that William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 418) can say of her is that
she was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“non usquequaque despicabilis formæ.”</span> We have already heard
of her studies at Romsey, and in her letters to Anselm (<abbr title="Epistles three">Epp. iii.</abbr> 55, 119)
the display of scriptural and classical learning might have satisfied Orderic
himself. It is more comforting to find in the second letter that she wishes
to bestow the abbey of Malmesbury on one bearing the English name of
Eadwulf. Anselm refuses his consent, because Eadwulf sent him a cup,
which seemed like an attempt at simony. Eadwulf however did in the end
become abbot.</p>

of Malmesbury is very strange. Ages after, Knighton (X Scriptt. 2375)
gives these English names an odd turn; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Multi de proceribus clam vel
palam a rege Henrico se subtraxerunt, fictis quibusdam occasiunculis vocantes
eum <em>Godrych Godefadyr</em>, et pro Roberto comite clam miserunt.”</span> In
his day Godric, in his various spellings, was doubtless, as now, in familiar
use as a surname. Godgifu must have been pretty well forgotten, except
in the form which she takes at Coventry, though I suppose that she too
survives in the surname <em>Goodeve</em>.</p>

curious remark that she was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in clericos bene melodos inconsiderate

 There is an important passage of William of Malmesbury about the
reeves, of whom we have heard so often; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Eo effectum est ut prodige
donantium non effugeret vitium, multimodas colonis suis deferens calumnias,
inferens injurias, auferens substantias, quo bonæ largitricis nacta famam,
suorum parvi pensaret contumeliam. Sed hæc qui recte judicare volet,
consiliis ministrorum imputabit, qui, more harpyarum, quicquid poterant
corripere unguibus, vel infodiebant marsupiis vel insumebant conviviis,
quorum fœculentis susurris aures oppleta, nævum honestissimæ menti
contraxit.”</span> In all this we learn the more to admire the constant care
of Anselm that no wrong should be done to his people.</p>

<p class="footnote">The story of Matilda and David is told also by Robert of Gloucester
(<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 434, 435, Hearne), who preserves the popular memory of “Mold þe god
quene” in several passages. Perhaps the strongest is,</p>

þam Túre on Lunden nihtes oðbærst, þær he on hæftneðe wæs, and to Normandige
fór.” Florence (1101) tells us how <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dunholmensis episcopus
Rannulfus, post nativitatem Domini, de custodia magna calliditate evasit,
mare transiit.”</span> William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 394) gives some details, but the
full story comes from Orderic (786). Flambard was to be <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“custodiendus

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In alia nave cum filii thesauro sui per pelagus in Neustriam ferebatur, et
a sociis ibidem pro scelestis incantationibus cum derisoriis gestibus passim
detrahebatur. Intereo totum piratis occurrentibus in ponto ærarium direptum

Florence (1101) and Orderic (787 A) are to the same effect; William of

 So says Florence; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ille [Rotbertus] consilio Rannulfi episcopi, quosdam
de regis butsecarlis adeo rerum diversarum promissionibus fregit, ut,
fidelitate quam regi debebant postposita, ad se transfugerent, et sibi ad
Angliam duces existerent.”</span> But the Chronicler says only, “Ac hi sume
æft æt þære neode abruðon, and fram þam cynge gecyrdon, and to þam eorle
Rotberte gebugan.” Is the cause of this difference between sea-folk and
land-folk to be found in the fact that the sailors must always have been
a professional class, coming one degree nearer to the nature of mercenaries
than the land forces?</p>

This he explains to be “<em>Hampton</em>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans le comté de Middlesex.”</span> If <em>Hantone</em>
were the right reading, it would of course mean <em>Southampton</em>, but we
may be quite sure that Andresen’s second reading <em>Altone</em> is what Wace wrote
in both places. I had myself thought of <em>Alton</em> before I saw the new text, but
I must confess that I have not studied this Hampshire campaign on the spot,
as I have studied those of Maine, Northumberland, Sussex, and Shropshire.</p>

 Both Robert of Bellême and William of Warren are marked by Orderic
(787 B) as traitors, but seemingly a little earlier; but the account in Florence
reads as if some at least of the nobles deserted at this stage, or at all events
after Robert had landed; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cujus adventu cognito, quidam de primoribus
Angliæ mox ad eum, ut ante proposuerant, transfugere, quidam vero cum
rege ficta mente remansere: sed episcopi, milites gregarii, et Angli, animo

 Wace has a good deal of vivid description at this stage, but this

the opportunity to draw a picture of the greatness of the Earl of Shropshire;
“On þisum geare to Natiuiteð wæs se cyng Heanrig on Westmynstre,

 The words of the annals quoted in <a href="#Page_301"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 301</a> look as if Gruffydd held
Anglesey strictly as a conqueror. The portion assigned to Cadwgan comes
from the Brut, which distinctly asserts their vassalage in its account of
Robert’s rebellion (1100 [1102]). “Robert and Arnulf invited the Britons,
who were subject to them, in respect of their possessions and titles, that
is to say, Cadwgan, Jorwerth, and Maredudd, sons of Bleddyn, son of
Cynvyn, to their assistance.”</p>

 Orderic (806 B) implies that the works at Bridgenorth were still going
on; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Brugiam, munitissimum castrum, super Sabrinam fluvium construebat.”</span>
But Florence is still more emphatic; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Muros quoque ac turres castellorum,
videlicet Brycge et Caroclove, die noctuque laborando et operando, perficere
modis omnibus festinavit.”</span> The Brut speaks obscurely of some
earlier dealings about Bridgenorth, of which we have no record elsewhere;
“Brygge, concerning which there had been war, against which the whole
deceit was perpetrated, and which he had founded contrary to the order
of the King.” The rebels are described generally as fortifying their castles
and surrounding them with ditches and walls, which are expressed in the
Welsh text by the loan words <span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">“O ffossyd a muroed.”</span></p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_1100" id="footnote_1100"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_1100"><span class="muchsmaller">[1100]</span></a>
 Orderic and the Brut stand alone among our authorities in mentioning
all the four castles, Arundel, Tickhill, Bridgenorth, and Shrewsbury. The
Chronicle and William of Malmesbury leave out Tickhill. Florence and the
Chronicle both leave out Shrewsbury. William of Malmesbury (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 396)
further confounds the siege of Arundel with that of Shrewsbury. From
Orderic we get a clear and full account, while the Brut supplies many
details as to the Welsh side of the business. Orderic opens his story in
a becoming manner; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex exercitum Angliæ convocavit, et Arundellum
castellum, quod prope litus maris situm est, obsedit.”</span></p>

<a href="#fnanchor_1101"><span class="muchsmaller">[1101]</span></a>
 The <em>Malvoisins</em> before Arundel seem to have struck all our writers. We
get them in the Chronicle; “Se cyng ferde and besæt þone castel æt Arundel,
ac þa he hine swa hraðe gewinnan ne mihte, he let þær toforan castelas
gemakian, and hi mid his mannan gesette.” They appear also in Florence,
William of Malmesbury, and Henry of Huntingdon. They were doubtless
of wood; but it is only from Roger of Wendover (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 170), who is followed
by Matthew Paris (<abbr title="Historia Anglorum">Hist. Angl.</abbr> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 190), that we get the direct statement,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“castellum aliud ligneum contra illud construxit.”</span></p>

 So Orderic; I add the stipulation about Robert from William of
Malmesbury; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Egregia sane conditione, ut dominus suus integra membrorum
salute Normanniam permitteretur abire.”</span> William’s account just
here is very confused; but this condition seems to have struck him, and
it explains some things which come later. He goes on to make this
strange statement; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Porro Scrobesbirienses per Radulfum tum abbatem
Sagii, postea Cantuariæ archiepiscopum, regi misere castelli claves, deditionis
præsentis indices, futuræ devotionis obsides.”</span> Now Orderic has, as
we shall see, a wholly different account of the surrender of Shrewsbury, and
Abbot Ralph, a victim of Robert of Bellême (see <abbr title="volume one page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 184), is not at all
likely to have been in one of his castles. Can it be that William has got
hold of the wrong castle and the wrong Ralph? Did Bishop Ralph of
Chichester act by any chance as mediator between the King and the
garrison of Arundel, a place in his diocese?</p>

 The name of Howard is not heard till the time of Edward the First,
and it is not noble till some generations later. If it really be the name of
an English office, <em>Hayward</em> or <em>Hogward</em>, and not a Norman <em>Houard</em>, then
Arundel, already a castle <abbr title="Tempore Regis Edwardi">T. R. E.</abbr>, has fittingly come back to the old
stock.</p>

carefully translates “Amúythia” as Shrewsbury, seems not to have known

gaudentes oppidani obviam processerunt, ipsumque naturalem dominum

 Corbet&mdash;“Corbatus”&mdash;&#8203;appears in Orderic (522 B, C), along with his
sons Roger and Robert, as a chief man in Shropshire under Earl Roger.
He must have died before the Survey, as only his sons appear there.
The lands which Corbet’s son Roger held of Earl Roger fill nearly two
columns in Domesday, 255 <span class="decoration">b</span>; they are followed by those of his brother
Robert in 256. Several of Roger’s holdings had been held by Eadric, and
in one lordship of Robert’s he is distinctly marked as “Edric Salvage.”
Several of Roger’s under-tenants are mentioned, of whom “Osulfus”
and “Ernuinus” must be English, while another lordship had been
held by <em>Ernui</em>. If these names mean the same person, then Earnwine or
Earnwig had held two lordships, one of which he lost altogether, while the
other he kept in the third degree, holding it under Roger son of Corbet,
who held it under Earl Roger. I suppose that these sons of Corbet have
nothing to do with <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Robertus filius Corbutionis”</span> who appears in the east
of England and whose name is said to be “Corpechun.” See Ellis, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 478.

 The action of the Welsh appears in all our accounts, but most fully in
Orderic and the Brut. The Annales Cambriæ say only <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Seditio [magna]
orta est inter Robertum Belleem et Henricum regem.”</span> William of Malmesbury
says spitefully, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Wallensibus pro motu fortunæ ad malum pronis.”</span>
But he seems somehow to connect them specially with Shrewsbury.
Florence is emphatic, and brings out the feudal relation between them and
Earl Robert (see above, <a href="#Page_424"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 424</a>); <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Walanos etiam, <em>suos homines</em>, ut promptiores
sibique fideliores ac paratiores essent ad id perficiendum quod volebat,
honoribus, terris, equis, armis incitavit, variisque donis largiter ditavit.”</span>
From the Brut we get the names of all three, Cadwgan, Jorwerth, and
Meredydd. Orderic leaves out Meredydd, and calls them sons of Rhys
instead of Bleddyn. He adds, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quos cum suis copiis exercitum regis
exturbare frequenter dirigebat.”</span></p>

B, C, by the name of “Guillelmus Pantulfus,” as one of Earl Roger’s chief
followers in Shropshire. His Shropshire holdings fill a large space in
Domesday, 257, 257 <span class="decoration">b</span>, where he appears as Pantulf and Pantul; and the
history of one of them has been commented on in <abbr title="Norman Conquest volume four page">N. C. vol. iv. p.</abbr> 737.

been persecuted (“verfolgt”) by Earl Roger on account of a share in the
murder of Mabel. If he had lost his lands then, he would hardly have
appeared in Domesday, and, according to Orderic, it was not Earl Roger,
but Robert of Bellême himself, who disinherited him.</p>

name. Bridgenorth could not be called “civitas;” Shrewsbury is so called
in Domesday, where the name does not imply a bishop’s see.</p>

accersiit, eosque datis muneribus et promissis demulcens, hosti caute surripuit
suæque parti cum viribus suis associavit.”</span> The detailed narrative comes
from the Brut, to whose author the different conduct of the brothers was
naturally more interesting than it was to Orderic. He speaks of the
message as “sent to the Britons,” and specially to Jorwerth, without mentioning
Cadwgan and Meredydd. He is the best authority for what went
on among his own people, while we may trust Orderic for the name of the
negotiator on the King’s side. Florence speaks quite generally; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Interim
Walanos, in quibus fiduciam magnam Rotbertus habuerat, ut juramenta
quæ illi juraverant irrita fierent, et ab illo penitus deficerent in illumque
consurgerent, donis modicis facile corrupit.”</span> The gifts actually given may
have been small, but the promises were certainly large.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_1134" id="footnote_1134"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_1134"><span class="muchsmaller">[1134]</span></a>
 The Brut makes the King “promise him more than he should obtain
from the earls, and the portion he ought to have of the land of the Britons.”
This is then defined as the districts mentioned in the text.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_1135" id="footnote_1135"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_1135"><span class="muchsmaller">[1135]</span></a>
 “Half of Dyved,” says the Brut, “as the other half had been given to
the son of Baldwin.” That Jorwerth’s half was to take in Pembroke
Castle appears from the words towards the end of this year’s entry, where
the King “took Dyved and the castle from him.” “The castle” in Dyfed
can only be Pembroke.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_1136" id="footnote_1136"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_1136"><span class="muchsmaller">[1136]</span></a>
 The Brut tells this at some length, speaking rather pointedly of “the
territory of Robert his lord.” See above, <a href="#Page_424"><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 424</a>, <a href="#Page_434">434</a>.</p>

coram cunctis juravit quod nisi oppidum in triduo sibi redderent, omnes
quoscunque de illis capere posset, suspendio perirent.”</span> These “municipes,”
the “oppidani” of the rest of the story, must be the three captains, Roger,
Robert, and Wulfgar. Odd as it seems, both “oppidanus” and “municeps”
are often used in this sense. See Ducange in Municeps.</p>

 The embassy at this stage comes only from the Brut, but as the later
one (see below, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 448) is mentioned also, we may accept it. The Welsh
writer naturally makes the most of his countrymen, and makes Robert
despair on the secession of Jorwerth. “He thought he had no power left
since Jorwerth had gone from him, for he was the principal among the
Britons, and the greatest in power.” This may not be an exaggeration,
as he lost with Jorwerth all power of doing anything in the open
field.</p>

brothers. Florence mentions Arnulf only. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Germanum illius [Rotberti]
Arnoldum paulo post, pro sua perfidia, simili sorte damnavit.”</span> To the
author of the Brut the departure of Arnulf was of special importance. The
King gives him his choice, “either to quit the kingdom and follow his brother,
or else”&mdash;I can only follow the translation&mdash;“to be at his will with his
head in his lap.” “When Ernulf heard that, he was most desirous of
going after his brother; so he delivered his castle [of Pembroke] to the
King, and the King placed a garrison in it.”</p>

to Shrewsbury, through the treachery of the King’s council. And his
pleadings and claims were arranged; and on his having come, all the
pleadings were turned against him, and the pleading continued through
the day, and at last he was adjudged to be fineable, and was afterwards
cast into the King’s prison, not according to law, but according to power.”
Again I should like to be able to judge of the translation. The Annals
say in one copy, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Iorward filius Bledint apud Saresberiam a rege Henrico
injuste capitur;”</span> in another, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“captus est ab hominibus regis apud Slopesburiam.”</span>
Shrewsbury is of course the right reading.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_1175"><span class="muchsmaller">[1175]</span></a>
 So says the Brut. The Annals also call him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“decus et solamen
Britanniæ.”</span></p>

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
